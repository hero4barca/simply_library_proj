This book reveals the most critical lessons learned over the authors' combined 30-plus years of exploring lean highways and shares stories based on real-world applications. The authors focus on areas where most lean efforts fail to illustrate steps to take to reenergize, accelerate and sustain a lean transformation. The book's ten chapters cover lean principles and thinking, lean leadership moves, the roadmap for lean transformation, common pitfalls of lean journeys, building an operating system, lean accounting, lean material management, lean in service organizations, and how individuals can apply lean to improve themselves. The book concludes with interviews of lean practitioners on the front lines of change at Chrysler, Ross Controls, DTE Energy. RSR Corporation, and Nemak."

A Short History of Nearly Everything,,Bill Bryson,eng,2305997,First Trade Paperback Edition,Broadway Books,544,,,,"In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining."
Bill Bryson's African Diary,,Bill Bryson,eng,1998364,,Broadway Books,55,,,,"In the early fall of 2002, famed travel Writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption."
Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words: A Writer's Guide to Getting It Right,,Bill Bryson,eng,4360697,,Broadway Books,256,,,,"A revised and updated edition of a humorous primer on the English language, expanded for an American audience, contains entries on correct and questionable usage, a glossary, and a pronunciation guide."
In a Sunburned Country,,Bill Bryson,eng,2611786,,Broadway Books,335,,,,"<b>A CLASSIC FROM THE <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF <i>ONE SUMMER </i></b><br /><br />Every time Bill Bryson walks out the door, memorable travel literature threatens to break out. His previous excursion along the Appalachian Trail resulted in the sublime national bestseller <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>. <i>In A Sunburned Country</i> is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity.<br /><br />Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book. Australia is an immense and fortunate land, and it has found in Bill Bryson its perfect guide."
I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years Away,,Bill Bryson,eng,3419048,,Broadway Books,304,,,,"After living in Britain for two decades, Bill Bryson recently moved back to the United States with his English wife and four children (he had read somewhere that nearly 3 million Americans believed they had been abducted by aliens--as he later put it, ""it was clear my people needed me""). They were greeted by a new and improved America that boasts microwave pancakes, twenty-four-hour dental-floss hotlines, and the staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item. <br /><br />Delivering the brilliant comic musings that are a Bryson hallmark, I'm a Stranger Here Myself recounts his sometimes disconcerting reunion with the land of his birth. The result is a book filled with hysterical scenes of one man's attempt to reacquaint himself with his own country, but it is also an extended if at times bemused love letter to the homeland he has returned to after twenty years away."
The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America,,Bill Bryson,eng,1888943,,William Morrow Paperbacks,299,,,,"'I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to'<br /><br />And, as soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he left. Des Moines couldn't hold him, but it did lure him back. After ten years in England, he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of trim and sunny place where the films of his youth were set. Instead, his search led him to Anywhere, USA; a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by lookalike people with a penchant for synthetic fibres. Travelling around thirty-eight of the lower states - united only in their mind-numbingly dreary uniformity - he discovered a continent that was doubly lost; lost to itself because blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a stranger in his own land.<br /><br />The Lost Continent is a classic of travel literature - hilariously, stomach-achingly funny, yet tinged with heartache - and the book that first staked Bill Bryson's claim as the most beloved writer of his generation."
Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe,,Bill Bryson,eng,3164459,,William Morrow Paperbacks,254,287604,Bryson and Katz,1,"Bill Bryson's first travel book, <i>The Lost Continent</i>, was unanimously acclaimed as one of the funniest books in years. In <i>Neither Here nor There</i> he brings his unique brand of humour to bear on Europe as he shoulders his backpack, keeps a tight hold on his wallet, and journeys from Hammerfest, the northernmost town on the continent, to Istanbul on the cusp of Asia. Fluent in, oh, at least one language, he retraces his travels as a student twenty years before.<br /><br />Whether braving the homicidal motorist of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant, window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn or disputing his hotel bill in Copenhagen, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations. He even goes to Liechtenstein."
Notes from a Small Island,,Bill Bryson,eng,940892,,William Morrow Paperbacks,324,170130,Notes from a Small Island,1,"<b>""Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved about Britain-which is to say, all of it.""</b><br /><br />After nearly two decades spent on British soil, Bill Bryson - bestselling author of <i>The Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America</i>-decided to return to the United States. (""I had recently read,"" Bryson writes, ""that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another, so it was clear that my people needed me."") But before departing, he set out on a grand farewell tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home.<br /><br />Veering from the ludicrous to the endearing and back again, <i>Notes from a Small Island</i> is a delightfully irreverent jaunt around the unparalleled floating nation that has produced zebra crossings, Shakespeare, Twiggie Winkie's Farm, and places with names like Farleigh Wallop and Titsey. The result is an uproarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain, from the satiric pen of an unapologetic Anglophile."
The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way,,Bill Bryson,eng,2170063,,William Morrow Paperbacks,270,,,,"With dazzling wit and astonishing insight, Bill Bryson—the acclaimed author of <em>The Lost Continent</em>—brilliantly explores the remarkable history, eccentricities, resilience and sheer fun of the English language. From the first descent of the larynx into the throat (why you can talk but your dog can't), to the fine lost art of swearing, Bryson tells the fascinating, often uproarious story of an inadequate, second-rate tongue of peasants that developed into one of the world's largest growth industries."

Along the way our heroes will encounter Elves and Ents, Uruk-hai and Orcs, Trolls, and Haradrim on their towering war-elephants, the mumakil. The Companion introduces readers to the monstrous Shelob the spider, to the Corsairs of Umbar, and to that pitiful but deadly creature Gollum.<br /><br />This omnibus edition also includes brand-new sections appearing in print for the first time, which take the story of the quest of the Fellowship beyond Mount Doom, all the way to the hearbreaking finale at the Grey Havens."

A full Rails application probably has less total code than the XML you'd need to configure the same application in other frameworks. With this book you'll learn how to use ""ActiveRecord"" to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the ""Action Pack"" framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and scaling. You'll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice (such as Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web server. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all. You'll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full Rails application is developed---iteratively and rapidly. Rails strives to honor the Pragmatic Programmer's ""DRY Principle"" by avoiding the extra work of configuration files and code annotations. You can develop in real-time: make a change, and watch it work immediately. Forget XML. Everything in Rails, from templates to control flow to business logic, is written in Ruby, the language of choice for programmers who like to get the job done well (and leave work ontime for a change). Rails is the framework of choice for the new generation of Web 2.0 developers. Agile Web Development with Rails is the book for that generation, written by Dave Thomas (Pragmatic Programmer and author of Programming Ruby) and David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Rails."
Ruby Quickly: Ruby and Rails for the Real World,,Mark   Watson,,4418,,Manning Publications,360,,,,"Enterprise software development is labor-intensive. And it is made more costly than necessasry by some of the most popular technologies which can be needlessly complex. The combination of Ruby and Ruby on Rails provides a simple, stable platform for cost-effective software development.<br /><br />The book quickly reviews Rails development and then move to essential enterprise subjects like Web Services (and their relationships with SOA), data persistence, messaging, interoperability with other platforms, handling documents and search, spell-checking, and report generation. It also covers new Web 2.0 technologies like Ajax and the read-write Web. It is rich in examples and covers numerous interesting topics readers will be surprised to see, such as advanced search with Ferret, how to access del.icio.us and Flickr from Ruby, or how to use Yahoo's general search from Ruby. The book closes with a look at the Semantic Web and why it makes sense to adopt semantic Web technologies."
The Bucaneers,"[{'id': '16', 'name': 'Edith Wharton', 'role': ''}, {'id': '296075', 'name': 'Marion Mainwaring', 'role': ''}]",Edith Wharton,,1483593,,Random House Value Publishing,,,,,"Wharton's final novel (completed by Marion Mainwaring after the author's death in 1937) revolves around American and British society in the 1870s. Told in large part through the eyes of American debutantes, the story portrays innocent, wide-eyed, almost ethereal girls who turn into socially conscious women with financial worries--unrecognizable even to themselves. The beginning sections quickly catch the listener's attention, with lush descriptions of rooms, clothes, and the heights of feminine beauty. We enter a world of intrigue: secrets, characters with past relationships that could prove fatal, and competition taken to its limits. Its literary value notwithstanding, this book might appeal to soap opera and romance fans. For more attentive listeners, it quickly becomes disconcerting as more and more characters with awkward British-sounding names are added. It's increasingly difficult to recall who's who without backing up the tape. Most libraries can pass on this one.-- Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, ""Soho Weekly News"", New York"

Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure. <br /><br />Brian had been distraught over his parents' impending divorce and the secret he carries about his mother, but now he is truly desolate and alone. Exhausted, terrified, and hungry, Brian struggles to find food and make a shelter for himself. He has no special knowledge of the woods, and he must find a new kind of awareness and patience as he meets each day's challenges. Is the water safe to drink? Are the berries he finds poisonous? <br /><br />Slowly, Brian learns to turn adversity to his advantage--an invading porcupine unexpectedly shows him how to make fire, a devastating tornado shows him how to retrieve supplies from the submerged airplane. Most of all, Brian leaves behind the self-pity he has felt about his predicament as he summons the courage to stay alive. <br /><br />A story of survival and of transformation, this riveting book has sparked many a reader's interest in venturing into the wild."

He describes how he made his own bows and arrows, and takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes.

From heated panels at Book Expo in Chicago to contretemps at writers’ watering holes in New York, voices—even fists—have been raised.<br /><br />Peck’s bracing philippic proposes that contemporary literature is at a dead end. Novelists have forfeited a wider audience, succumbing to identity politicking and self-reflexive postmodernism. In the torrent of responses to this fulguration, opinions were not so much divided as cleaved in two with, for example, Carlin Romano contending that “Peck’s judgments are worse than nasty—they are hysterical” and Benjamin Schwarz retorting that “in his meticulous attention to diction, his savage wit, his exact and rollicking prose and his disdain for pseudointellectual flatulence, Dale Peck is Mencken’s heir.”<br /><br /><i>Hatchet Jobs</i> includes swinging critiques of the work of, among others, Sven Birkerts, Julian Barnes, Philip Roth, Colson Whitehead, Jim Crace, Stanley Crouch, and Rick Moody.<br /><br /><br />"

Led by Yana Maddock and Sean Shongili, Petaybee’s protectors prevailed.

For Ronan and Murel are more than human. Like their father, each can transform into a seal and converse telepathically with the planet’s creatures–such as the friendly otter whose life they save one day from a pack of ravenous wolves.<br /><br />But the twins’ bravery has unforeseen results when a visiting scientist witnesses their startling metamorphosis and becomes obsessed with their capture. To protect their children, Sean and Yana send them to stay with a powerful family friend on an orbiting space station.

It appears that portions of the sea are heating up and a landmass is suddenly rising from the depths. To investigate the startling occurrence, Sean heads out to the open water in his seal form.

The Changeling,,Kate Horsley,eng,4431,,Shambhala,339,,,,"Here, the author of the acclaimed <i>Confessions of a Pagan Nun </i> takes us to fourteenth-century Ireland for a strange and luminous tale of the elusive nature of identity and of triumph in adversity. <i>The Changeling </i> is the story of Grey, a peasant girl who is raised as a boy, and who, until adolescence, never doubts herself to be male. The revelation of her womanhood marks the beginning of her journey through a succession of changing identities--including son, wife, warrior, and mother--each of which brings its own special wisdom, but none of which, she discovers, can ultimately define her. In the course of her adventurous life, Grey deals with all the challenges of her tumultuous age--from political oppression to corrupt Church hierarchy to the horrors of the Black Death--ultimately finding peace and a kind of redemption by embracing the beautifully impermanent quality of identity that her unusual life has enabled her to understand.

"The Changeling (Daughters of England, #15)",,Philippa Carr,eng,4434,,Ivy Books,369,40421,Daughters of England,15,"Rebecca Mandeville<br /><br />The story of <em>The Changeling</em> is told by Angelet's daughter, Rebecca, who was born in Benedict Lansdon's grandfather's house in an Australian gold-mining township. Before Rebecca was born, her father had died saving another man's life. She had always looked up to him as a great hero and when she heard that her mother was to marry Benedict Lansdon, she was deeply shocked.<br /><br />The prolific British author of historical romances (<em>The Pool of St. Branok</em>) continues her lavishly entwined narrative of the families connected to Benedict Lansdon, now a recently bereaved widower, absentee father and wealthy seeker of a Parliament seat. Narrated by Benedict's aggrieved stepdaughter, Rebecca, this complex tale of love and betrayal concerns a three-cornered sibling relationship involving Rebecca, her half-sister, Belinda, and Lucie, a country waif informally adopted by Rebecca. Aware that her father blames her for her mother's death in childbirth, Belinda takes refuge in michievous behavior. Placid Lucie, however, fits in well with the family, though her lineage is suspect and clouded with mysterious events at St. Branok's pool. Although Belinda seems the most obvious ""changeling"", Carr sustains an air of doubt and intrigue. The ambience of the Cornish countryside and of Victorian London permeate this piquantly Gothic family saga."

In 1965, John McPhee published his first book, <i>A Sense of Where You Are</i>; a decade later, he had published eleven others. His fertility, his precision and grace as a stylist, his wit and uncanny brilliance in choosing subject matter, his crack storytelling skills have made him into one of our best writers: a journalist whom L.E.

He rides from Atlanta to Tacoma alongside Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, <br />eighteen-wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmats. McPhee attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for a tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the tight-assed Illinois River on a<br />towboat pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being a good deal longer than the <i>Titanic</i>. And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, <br />in a homemade skiff in 1839.<br /><br /><i>Uncommon Carriers </i>is classic work by McPhee, in prose distinguished, as always, by its author's warm humor, keen insight, and rich sense of human character."
Heirs of General Practice,,John McPhee,eng,4440,1st THUS edition,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",128,,,,"<i>Heirs of General Practice </i>is a frieze of glimpses of young doctors with patients of every age—about a dozen physicians in all, who belong to the new medical specialty called family practice. They are people who have addressed themselves to a need for a unifying generalism in a world that has become greatly subdivided by specialization, physicians who work with the ""unquantifiable idea that a doctor who treats your grandmother, your father, your niece, and your daughter will be more adroit in treating you.""<br /><br />These young men and women are seen in their examining rooms in various rural communities in Maine, but Maine is only the example. Their medical objectives, their successes, the professional obstacles they do and do not overcome are representative of any place family practitioners are working. While essential medical background is provided, McPhee's masterful approach to a trend significant to all of us is replete with affecting, and often amusing, stories about both doctors and their charges."
The Control of Nature,,John McPhee,en-US,1391038,,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",288,,,,"While John McPhee was working on his previous book, <i>Rising from the Plains</i>, he happened to walk by the engineering building at the University of Wyoming, where words etched in limestone said: ""Strive on--the control of Nature is won, not given."" In the morning sunlight, that central phrase--""the control of nature""--seemed to sparkle with unintended ambiguity. Bilateral, symmetrical, it could with equal speed travel in opposite directions. For some years, he had been planning a book about places in the world where people have been engaged in all-out battles with nature, about (in the words of the book itself) ""any struggle against natural forces--heroic or venal, rash or well advised--when human beings conscript themselves to fight against the earth, to take what is not given, to rout the destroying enemy, to surround the base of Mt. Olympus demanding and expecting the surrender of the gods."" His interest had first been sparked when he went into the Atchafalaya--the largest river swamp in North America--and had learned that virtually all of its waters were metered and rationed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' project called Old River Control.<br /><br />In the natural cycles of the Mississippi's deltaic plain, the time had come for the Mississippi to change course, to shift its mouth more than a hundred miles and go down the Atchafalaya, one of its distributary branches. The United States could not afford that--for New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and all the industries that lie between would be cut off from river commerce with the rest of the nation. At a place called Old River, the Corps therefore had built a great fortress--part dam, part valve--to restrain the flow of the Atchafalaya and compel the Mississippi to stay where it is.<br /><br />In Iceland, in 1973, an island split open without warning and huge volumes of lava began moving in the direction of a harbor scarcely half a mile away. It was not only Iceland's premier fishing port (accounting for a large percentage of Iceland's export economy) but it was also the only harbor along the nation's southern coast. As the lava threatened to fill the harbor and wipe it out, a physicist named Thorbjorn Sigurgeirsson suggested a way to fight against the flowing red rock--initiating an all-out endeavor unique in human history. On the big island of Hawaii, one of the world's two must eruptive hot spots, people are not unmindful of the Icelandic example. McPhee went to Hawaii to talk with them and to walk beside the edges of a molten lake and incandescent rivers.<br /><br />Some of the more expensive real estate in Los Angeles is up against mountains that are rising and disintegrating as rapidly as any in the world. After a complex coincidence of natural events, boulders will flow out of these mountains like fish eggs, mixed with mud, sand, and smaller rocks in a cascading mass known as debris flow. Plucking up trees and cars, bursting through doors and windows, filling up houses to their eaves, debris flows threaten the lives of people living in and near Los Angeles' famous canyons. At extraordinary expense the city has built a hundred and fifty stadium-like basins in a daring effort to catch the debris.<br /><br />Taking us deep into these contested territories, McPhee details the strategies and tactics through which people attempt to control nature. Most striking in his vivid depiction of the main contestants: nature in complex and awesome guises, and those who would attempt to wrest control from her--stubborn, often ingenious, and always arresting characters.<br />"

The structure of the book never changed, but its breadth caused him to complete it in stages, under the overall title <i>Annals of the Former World</i>.<br /><br />Like the terrain it covers, <i>Annals of the Former World</i> tells a multilayered tale, and the reader may choose one of many paths through it. As clearly and succinctly written as it is profoundly informed, this is our finest popular survey of geology and a masterpiece of modern nonfiction.<br /><br /><i>Annals of the Former World </i>is the winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction."

You are something wonderful, you are—people of the city—and we, who are almost without exception strangers here, are as absorbed with you as you seem to be with the numbers on our hanging scales."" So opens the title piece in this collection of John McPhee's classic essays, grouped here with four others, including ""Brigade de Cuisine,"" a profile of an artistic and extraordinary chef; ""The Keel of Lake Dickey,"" in which a journey down the whitewater of a wild river ends in the shadow of a huge projected dam; a report on plans for the construction of nuclear power plants that would float in the ocean; and a pinball shoot-out between two prizewinning journalists."

I raise that semaphore here at the start so no one will feel misled by an opening passage in which a slim young woman who is not in any sense a geologist steps down from a train in Rawlins, Wyoming, in order to go north by stagecoach into country that was still very much the Old West.</i><br /> <br />So begins John McPhee's <i>Rising from the Plains.</i> If you like to read about geology, you will find good reading here. If, on the other hand, you are not much engaged by the spatial complexities of the science, you could miss a richness of human history that has its place among the strata described. Sometimes it is said of geologists that they reflect in their professional styles the sort of country in which they grew up. Nowhere could that be more true than in the life of a geologist born in the center of Wyoming and raised on an isolated ranch. This is the story of that ranch, soon after the turn of the century, and of the geologist who grew up there, at home with the composition of the high country in the way that someone growing up in a coastal harbor would be at home with the vagaries of the sea. While <i>Rising from the Plains</i> is a portrayal of extraordinary people, it is also a history of the landscape around them, where, with remarkable rapidity, mountains came up out of the flat terrain. Gradually, the mountains were buried, until only the higher peaks remained above a vast plain. Recently, they have been exhumed, and they stand now as the Rockies. <br /><br /><i>Rising from the Plains</i> is John McPhee's third book on geology and geologists. Following <i>Basin and Range</i> and <i>In Suspect Terrain,</i> it continues to present a cross section of North America along the fortieth parallel—a series gathering under the overall title <i>Annals of the Former World.</i><br /><br /><i>Description from the first-edition dust jacket (1986). </i>"

The Heidi Chronicles,,Wendy Wasserstein,eng,17506124,,Dramatists Play Service,81,,,,"Comprised of a series of interrelated scenes, the play traces the coming of age of Heidi Holland, a successful art historian, as she tries to find her bearings in a rapidly changing world. Gradually distancing herself from her friends, she watches them move from the idealism and political radicalism of their college years through militant feminism and, eventually, back to the materialism that they had sought to reject in the first place. Heidi's own path to maturity involves an affair with the glib, arrogant Scoop Rosenbaum, a womanizing lawyer/publisher who eventually marries for money and position; a deeper but even more troubling relationship with a charming, witty young pediatrician, Peter Patrone, who turns out to be gay; and increasingly disturbing contacts with the other women, now much changed, who were a part of her childhood and college years. Eventually Heidi comes to accept the fact that liberation can be achieved only if one is true to oneself, with goals that come out of need rather than circumstance. As the play ends she is still ""alone,"" but having adopted an orphaned baby, it is clear that she has begun to find a sense of fulfillment and continuity that may well continue to elude the others of her anxious, self-centered generation."

Getting Results with Curriculum Mapping,,Heidi Hayes Jacobs,eng,4458,,ASCD,192,,,,"Curriculum mapping is said to remove the clutter that may interfere with learning and teaching. It sorts lessons and units into consistent plans that teachers, schools, and districts can access to ensure content is consistent and also progresses along with students. Jacobs and her contributors describe how to set up a mapping project, work on the project as a team, and use mapping in special settings such as in an independent or alternative school. They show how to create consistent benchmarks and use the resulting maps to integrate new technology, new data, decision-making structures, and staff development opportunities.

There's Always Enough: The Miraculous Move of God in Mozambique,"[{'id': '51', 'name': 'Rolland Baker', 'role': ''}, {'id': '11872', 'name': 'Heidi Baker', 'role': ''}]",Rolland Baker,eng,4455,,Sovereign World,192,,,,"Today in one of Southern Africa's most disaster-torn nations, Rolland and Heidi Baker are at the center of a major move of God's Spirit. The last four years have seen them plant and take responsibility for around 6,000 churches as thousands of Mozambiquans have given their lives to Christ in an unprecedented revival. During this time, they have also witnessed numerous acts of God's power. Miracles of provision, healing, deliverance, and even raising the dead, have become every day occurrences. This adventure began when Rolland and Heidi Baker, founders of IRIS Ministries, and both natives of California, USA, answered God's call to minister to the poorest of the poor. Rolland describes this best in the introduction to the forthcoming book that tells the story, "" There's Always Enough"". In his introduction to the book, Rolland Baker says: ""Jesus developed our faith over the years in many countries and ministry situations for a reason. Today He has given us oversight over five thousand churches in one of the poorest areas of the world. We live in Mozambique, in the south-east corner of Africa, a land that has suffered horribly from decades of warfare and natural disaster. Finally the people are desperate for Jesus and no other. Revival is spreading. In large sections of central Mozambique and southern Malawi we have simple, mud-hut churches in virtually every village. They grow until there are as many as can hear the sound of a preacher's voice."" ""More are being added continuously, and now others in countries around us are calling for ministry and help, desperate to be a part of this fire. The gospel of Jesus Christ is enough for them all. He is good and faithful,the Master Lover. They just want Him. They have been poor and wretched, but now they possess all things in Him. We dare to approach them, we dare to preach to them, we dare to pick up the helpless, abandoned and dying, because He died for us and rose again on our behalf. We eat and drink from His body and blood, and as a result, there will always be enough..."""

Brian Herbert writes about these years with a truthful intensity that brings every facet of his father's brilliant, and sometimes troubled, genius to full light.<br /><br />Insightful and provocative, containing family photos never published anywhere, this absorbing biography offers Brian Herbert' unique personal perspective on one of the most enigmatic and creative talents of our time.<br /><br /><i>Dreamer of Dune</i> is a 2004 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Related Work."

Ruby Ann's Down Home Trailer Park BBQin' Cookbook,,Ruby Ann Boxcar,eng,4500,,Citadel,206,,,,"From Publishers Weekly:<br /><br />Free of the restraints of haute cuisine, the Michelin guide and roofed kitchens in general, Boxcar weighs in with highly entertaining recipes and helpless hints, straight from her double-wide trailer at the High Chaparral Trailer Park in Pangburn, Ark. It should be noted that the term barbecue, in this context, refers to anything edible that has come into contact with a heat source in the out-of-doors. The results are rarely pretty but make for the kind of entertaining reading often associated with milk coming out of one's nose. The necessity for a third volume of such d‚tritus-blanc delicacies (Ruby Anne's Down Home Trailer Park Cookbook started the wheels rolling) was brought about not by the public's overwhelming demand but rather, as the author suggests, by a scarcity of government-surplus cheese, which was a staple of so many of her previous creations: budget-conscious chefs will have to dole out for Velveeta this time around to fill their Armadillo Eggs (a.k.a. stuffed jalapenos). Other frights from the cupboard show up in Billy Bob's Kabobs, a skewer full of Spam and bell peppers. Yes, one could try their hand at El Wienie Mexicano, which takes taco seasoning to a place it best ought not to go, but the better bet is to hit the Taco Bell drive-thru and then settle in with the trailer park updates and cooking tips that bookend the Pork Entombed Trout and the Born-Again Baked Beans.

Untouchables: My Family's Triumphant Journey Out of the Caste System in Modern India,,Narendra Jadhav,en-US,4514,,Scribner,320,,,,"Every sixth human being in the world today is an Indian, and every sixth Indian is an untouchable. For thousands of years the untouchables, or Dalits, the people at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, have been treated as subhuman. Their story has rarely been told. This remarkable book achieves something altogether unprecedented: it gives voice to India's voiceless. <br /> In <i>Untouchables,</i> Narendra Jadhav tells the awe-inspiring story of his family's struggle for equality and justice in India. While most Dalits had accepted their lowly position as fate, Jadhav's father rebelled against the oppressive caste system and fought against all odds to forge for his children a destiny that was never ordained. <br /> Based on his father's diaries and family stories, Jadhav has written the triumphant story of his parents -- their great love, unwavering courage, and eventual victory in the struggle to free themselves and their children from the caste system. Jadhav vividly brings his parents' world to light and unflinchingly documents the life of untouchables -- the hunger, the cruel humiliations, the perpetual fear and brutal abuse. <br /> Compelling and deeply compassionate, <i>Untouchables</i> is a son's tribute to his parents, an illuminating chronicle of one of the most important moments in Indian history, and an eye-opening work of nonfiction that gives readers access and insight into the lives of India's 165 million Dalits, whose struggle for equality continues even today."

The authors argue that, despite efforts to ameliorate their condition, a considerable edifice of discrimination persists. The book promises to make a major contribution to the social and economic debates on poverty, while its wide-ranging perspectives will ensure a readership from across the disciplines."

There is hunger and deprivation, to be sure, but also a sense of community, an easy acceptance of petty crime and violence, the saving grace of sports and organized activities led by caring adults, the off-again on-again aid from relatives, the inexplicable cruelty and unexpected generosity, and escape through education. But there is much here that is peculiarly and vividly Indian as well. Primary among these is the factor of caste, a hierarchical system unrelated to race but based on ancient principles of hereditary pollution and purity, with Brahmans the purest and Untouchables the most polluted. Second is the presence of a hero so important he is described as a ""wave,"" and surely no despised group has ever had a leader as meaningful as Dr. B. R. (Babasaheb) Ambedkar was and remains for India's awakened and ambitious Dalits. Third is nature, with Moon's compelling descriptions of Nagpur's heat and the vivid joy brought by the monsoon. Indeed, every tree, every fruit, every nook and cranny of the world in and around the vasti plays an important part in his story. Dalit literature, poetry, plays, and autobiographies have been one of the most important developments in the culture of India in the past thirty years, yet little has been translated for a Western audience. Vasant Moon's Growing Up Untouchable, the first Dalit autobiography to be published in English, is a moving and eloquent testament to a uniquely Indian life as well as to the universal human spirit."
The Book of Evidence,,Peter Achinstein,,4518,,Oxford University Press,304,,,,"What is required for something to be evidence for a hypothesis? <br /><br />In this fascinating, elegantly written work, distinguished philosopher of science Peter Achinstein explores this question, rejecting typical philosophical and statistical theories of evidence. He claims these theories are much too weak to give scientists what they want--a good reason to believe--and, in some cases, they furnish concepts that mistakenly make all evidential claims a priori. <br /><br />Achinstein introduces four concepts of evidence, defines three of them by reference to ""potential"" evidence, and characterizes the latter using a novel epistemic interpretation of probability. The resulting theory is then applied to philosophical and historical issues. Solutions are provided to the ""grue,"" ""ravens,"" ""lottery,"" and ""old-evidence"" paradoxes, and to a series of questions. These include whether explanations or predictions furnish more evidential weight, whether individual hypotheses or entire theoretical systems can receive evidential support, what counts as a scientific discovery, and what sort of evidence is required for it. The historical questions include whether Jean Perrin had non-circular evidence for the existence of molecules, what type of evidence J.J. Thomson offered for the existence of the electron, and whether, as is usually supposed, he really discovered the electron. Achinstein proposes answers in terms of the concepts of evidence introduced. <br /><br />As the premier book in the fabulous new series Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Science, this volume is essential for philosophers of science and historians of science, as well as for statisticians, scientists with philosophical interests, and anyone curious about scientific reasoning."

"Madeleine L'Engle: Author of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" (People in Focus)",,Doreen Gonzales,eng,4534,,,,146832,People in Focus,,"Gonzales addresses her audience in a style and tone that are easily accessible and clearly up to the job of presenting a well-known author who has some fairly complex philosophical ideas and an unusual, although not iconoclastic, lifestyle. L'Engle comes across as a woman with an abiding commitment to her family as well as a lifelong lust for learning and the more spiritual aspects of existence. There are a couple of awkward phrasings and a few places where unexplained questions persist. Some of the book's success is due to the author's direct contact with her subject; Gonzales has obviously interviewed her extensively. The bibliography is modest enough to entice rather than threaten reluctant younger readers and yet comprehensive enough to suggest to more scholarly readers that Gonzales has done her homework. While she is admiring and discreet, she has not sheltered or distorted the facts; even L'Engle's irritability in the morning hours comes through. The one shortfall of the book is the poor quality of some of the black-and-white photographs. Still, their informality and their unique, if somewhat second-rate photographic technique, give a sense of history to one of the great women in children's literature. --Ruth K.

Vicksburg's Long Shadow: The Civil War Legacy of Race and Remembrance,,Christopher Waldrep,,4551,,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,344,,,,"During the hottest days of the summer of 1863, while the nation's attention was focused on a small town in Pennsylvania known as Gettysburg, another momentous battle was being fought along the banks of the Mississippi. In the longest single campaign of the war, the siege of Vicksburg left 19,000 dead and wounded on both sides, gave the Union Army control of the Mississippi, and left the Confederacy cut in half. In this highly-anticipated new work, Christopher Waldrep takes a fresh look at how the Vicksburg campaign was fought and remembered. He begins with a gripping account of the battle, deftly recounting the experiences of African-American troops fighting for the Union. Waldrep shows how as the scars of battle faded, the memory of the war was shaped both by the Northerners who controlled the battlefield and by the legacies of race and slavery that played out over the decades that followed."

Comedy after Postmodernism: Rereading Comedy from Edward Lear to Charles Willeford,,Kirby Olson,,4570,,Texas Tech University Press,184,,,,"Is comedy postmodern?Kirby Olson posits that no one has been more marginalized than the comic writer, whose irreverent truths have always made others uncomfortable. In a literary age that purports to champion diversity, comic writers remain an underclass huddling at the fringes of the canon. Olson challenges the status quo by inviting the comic writer into the center of literary debate.In the growing discipline of humor studies, Olson is the first to create a substantial link between the fields of comedy and postmodernism, discovering in comic writers a philosophy of oddness and paradox that parallels and extends the work of the major postmodern thinkers.With elegant clarity, Comedy After Post-modernism examines: Edward Lear as he invents a comic picturesque to challenge the sublime of Kant and Ruskin Gregory Corso as he explodes the Great Chain of Being of his early Catholicism Philippe Soupault as a comic surrealist undoing the sacrificial aesthetics of André Breton P.G. Wodehouse as a social thinker with surprisingly deep affinities to anarchist Peter Kropotkin and radical social theorist Charles Fourier Stewart Home, the infamously violent punk author, as a pacifist whose narrative questions Marxist-anarchist terrorism in favor of patience and tolerance Charles Willeford, the maestro of the black humor police procedural, as a postmodern philosopher who deepens the problems of ethical and aesthetic judgment after postmodernism. “An original, splendidly researched, and necessary book. By pointing to the vast excluded literature of ‘comic writers,’ Dr. Olson opens the door to a postmodern scholarship capable of greater flexibility. Comedy After Postmodernism evinces a lucid, passionate, and engaging style.” —Andrei Codrescu There was an old man on the Border, Who lived in the utmost disorder;He danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat,Which vexed all the folks on the Border.—From The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear"

Duras, by then married and part of a French resistance network headed by François Mitterand, tells of nursing her starving husband back to health after his return from Bergen-Belsen, interrogating a suspected collaborator, and playing a game of cat and mouse with a Gestapo officer who was attracted to her.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, <i>Treasure Island</i> is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like <i>Treasure Island</i> that can keep boys and old men happy.'"

This book assists all players in their efforts to improve, and provides fresh insights into the opening and early middlegame.<br /><br />Rowson presents many new ideas on how Black should best combat White's early initiative, and make use of the extra information that he gains as a result of moving second. For instance, he shows that in some cases a situation he calls 'Zugzwang Lite' can arise, where White finds himself lacking any constructive moves. He also takes a close look at the theories of two players who, in differing styles, have specialized in championing Black's cause: Mihai Suba and Andras Adorjan. Readers are also equipped with a 'mental toolkit' that will enable them to handle many typical over-the-board situations with greater success, and avoid a variety of psychological pitfalls.<br /><br /><i>Chess for Zebras</i> offers fresh insights into human idiosyncrasies in all phases of the game. The depth and breadth of this book will therefore help players to appreciate chess at a more profound level, and make steps towards sustained and significant improvement.<br /><br /><br />"

Asian American Studies. In his long-overdue first collection of essays, noted journalist and NPR commentator Andrew Lam explores his life-long struggle for identity as a Viet Kieu, or a Vietnamese national living abroad. At age eleven, Lam, the son of a South Vietnamese general, came to California on the eve of the fall of Saigon to communist forces. He traded his Vietnamese name for a more American one and immersed himself in the allure of the American Dream: something not clearly defined for him or his family. Reflecting on the meanings of the Vietnam War to the Vietnamese people themselves--particularly to those in exile--Lam picks with searing honesty at the roots of his doubleness and his parents' longing for a homeland that no longer exists."
Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume,,Mandy Aftel,,15962,,North Point Press,,,,,"An artisan perfumer reveals a lost art and its mysterious, sensual history. <br />For centuries, people have taken what seems to be an instinctive pleasure in rubbing scents into their skin. Perfume has helped them to pray, to heal, and to make love. And as long as there has been perfume, there have been perfumers, or rather the priests, shamans, and apothecaries who were their predecessors. Yet, in many ways, perfumery is a lost art, its creative and sensual possibilities eclipsed by the synthetic ingredients of which contemporary perfumes are composed, which have none of the subtlety and complexity of essences derived from natural substances, nor their lush histories. ""Essence and Alchemy"" resurrects the social and metaphysical legacy that is entwined with the evolution of perfumery, from the dramas of the spice trade to the quests of the alchemists to whom today's perfumers owe a philosophical as well as a practical debt. Mandy Aftel tracks scent through the boudoir and the bath and into the sanctums of worship, offering insights on the relationship of scent to sex, solitude, and the soul. Along the way, she imparts instruction in the art of perfume compositions, complete with recipes, guiding the reader in a process of transformation of materials that continues to follow the alchemical dictum solve et coagula (dissolve and combine) and is itself aesthetically and spiritually transforming.<br />"

Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.<br /><br />Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book “trilogy” that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you’ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you’ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python’s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic<i>;</i> and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.<br /><br />A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat–while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. <br /><br />By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration– a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject’s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust. For the countless fans of Douglas Adams and his unique and winsome world, here is a wonderful postcard: to be read, reread, and treasured for the memories it bears.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

Bullshit Artist: The 9/11 Leadership Myth,,Ron Schalow,,4686,,Booksurge Publishing,326,,,,"No Conspiracy Theories in This Book-Just a True Story of Spleen Clutching Incompetence, Forehead Slapping Stupidity and Ear Sweating Cowardice. Tough on terrorism? Strong on defense? Leadership? Not quite. Compared to George W. Bush's gutless and incompetent performance on 9/11, Brownie looks like General Patton. The President pulled a FEMA for 102 minutes while al Qaeda struck with impunity-but since W's actions on September 11 were largely ignored by the national media-most people weren't even aware of the little man's 7 minutes of ass sitting paralysis in an elementary school classroom until Michael Moore's film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" exposed the frozen leader of the free world-let alone know about Bush's clueless loitering-cutting and running, and terrorist appeasing for the other 95 minutes of the attacks. Ron Schalow's ""Bullshit Artist"" provides a full account of the President's lollygagging, decision avoiding and hiding in the heartland on the tragic day-in Bush's own words and the tortuously twisty recollections of the White House brain trust-Card, Rove, Fleischer, Hughes, Rice, Cheney &amp; Rumsfeld-plus the traditional bushel basket of excuses that ensue after every Bush failure. And Bush supporters like Bill Sammon, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, John Podhoretz, David Frum and Dick Morris also chime in to provide cover for the cowardly Commander-in-Chief-evidently more concerned about the image of their beloved politician than the security of the American people. Then, as if his flaccid failures on 9/11 weren't shameful enough, a delusional GW boasts of his defense prowess at least 19 times per day in the following years-whoring the terrorist attacks and 3,000 deaths on his watch to his immense political benefit-a Bullshit Artist at his best.<br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://www.bullshitartist.net"">www.bullshitartist.net</a>"

Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America,,Garry Wills,en-US,4691,,Simon & Schuster,317,,,,"The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation ""a new birth of freedom""--by tracing its first birth to the Declaration of Independence (which called all men equal) rather than to the Constitution (which tolerated slavery). In the space of a mere 272 words, Lincoln brought to bear the rhetoric of the Greek Revival, the categories of Transcendentalism, and the imagery of the ""rural cemetery"" movement. His entire life and previous training, his deep political experience, went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece. As Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel has been restored to its bold colors and forgotten details, Garry Wills restores the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln at Gettysburg combines the same extraordinary quality of observation that defines Wills's previous best-selling portraits of modern presidents, such as Reagan's America and Nixon Agonistes, with the iconoclastic scholarship of his studies of our founding documents, such as Inventing America. By examining both the Address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew and reveals much about a President so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world, to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns. The Civil War is, to most Americans, what Lincoln wanted it to mean. Now Garry Wills explains how Lincoln wove a spell that has not, yet, been broken."

Characters stop what they're doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs. Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or two.

The Year of Magical Thinking,,Joan Didion,en-US,1659905,,Knopf Publishing Group,227,,,,"From one of America’s most iconic writers, a stunning book of electric honesty and passion.

A Book of Common Prayer,,Joan Didion,eng,1043020,,Vintage International,272,,,,"Writing with the telegraphic swiftness and microscopic sensitivity that have made her one of our most distinguished journalists, Joan Didion creates a shimmering novel of innocence and evil.<b>A Book of Common Prayer</b> is the story of two American women in the derelict Central American nation of Boca Grande. Grace Strasser-Mendana controls much of the country's wealth and knows virtually all of its secrets; Charlotte Douglas knows far too little. ""Immaculate of history, innocent of politics,"" she has come to Boca Grande vaguely and vainly hoping to be reunited with her fugitive daughter.

Where I Was From,,Joan Didion,eng,1371028,,Vintage,240,,,,"In her moving and insightful new book, Joan Didion reassesses parts of her life, her work, her history and ours. A native Californian, Didion applies her scalpel-like intelligence to the state’s ethic of ruthless self-sufficiency in order to examine that ethic’s often tenuous relationship to reality.<br /><br />Combining history and reportage, memoir and literary criticism, <b>Where I Was From</b><i> </i>explores California’s romances with land and water; its unacknowledged debts to railroads, aerospace, and big government; the disjunction between its code of individualism and its fetish for prisons. Whether she is writing about her pioneer ancestors or privileged sexual predators, robber barons or writers (not excluding herself), Didion is an unparalleled observer, and her book is at once intellectually provocative and deeply personal."

And, in 1975, the year in which much of this bitterly funny novel is set, America is doing its best to lose track of its one-time client, the lethally hemorrhaging republic of South Vietnam.As conceived by Joan Didion, these personages and events constitute the terminal fallout of democracy, a fallout that also includes fact-finding junkets, senatorial groupies, the international arms market, and the Orwellian newspeak of the political class. Moving deftly from Honolulu to Jakarta, between romance, farce, and tragedy, <b>Democracy</b> is a tour de force from a writer who can dissect an entire society with a single phrase."

  <div><br />Determining that he is locked in, the man--identified only as Mr. Blank--begins reading a manuscript he finds on the desk, the story of another prisoner, set in an alternate world the man doesn't recognize. Nevertheless, the pages seem to have been left for him, along with a haunting set of photographs. As the day passes, various characters call on the man in his cell--vaguely familiar people, some who seem to resent him for crimes he can't remember--and each brings frustrating hints of his identity and his past. All the while an overhead camera clicks and clicks, recording his movements, and a microphone records every sound in the room. Someone is watching.</div>

An Art of Desire: Reading Paul Auster,,Bernd Herzogenrath,,4734,,Brill/Rodopi,245,,,,"<i>An Art of Desire. Reading Paul Auster</i> the first book-length study solely devoted to the novels of Paul Auster. From the vantage-point of poststructuralist theory, especially Lacanian psychoanalysis and Derridean deconstruction, this book explores the relation of Auster's novels <i>City of Glass</i>, <i>In the Country of Last Things</i>, <i>Moon Palace</i>, and <i>The Music of Chance</i> to the rewriting and deconstruction of genre conventions; their connections to concepts such as catastrophe theory, the sublime, Freud's notion of the 'death drive;' as well as the philosophical underpinnings of his work. At the focus of this study, however, is the concept of desire, an important concept in the writings of both Auster and Lacan, and the various manifestations of this concept in Auster's novels.<br /> Auster's novels always emphasize a kind of outside of the text (chance, the real, the unsayable), a kind of hope for a 'transparent language, ' a hope, however, that is exactly posited as impossible to fulfill. The relation of Daniel Quinn, Anna Blume, Marco Fogg and Jim Nashe to this lack is the motor of their desire, the driving force for the subject that has <i>always already</i> left the real and has been inscribed into the representational system called 'reality.' It is here, in its relation to the signifier, that the subject's desire is played out, that its experience is ordered, interpreted, and articulated. It is their ability to make connections, to proliferate, to 'affirm free-play, ' their ability 'not to bemoan the absence of the centre' that ultimately decides over success or failure of Auster's subjects - whether they partake in the 'joyous errance of the sign, ' or whether their fate is that of the 'unfortunate traveler.'"

Their essays provide the fullest analysis available of Auster's themes of solitude, chance, and paternity found in works such as <i>The Invention of Solitude</i>, <i>City of Glass</i>, <i>Ghosts</i>, <i>The Locked Room</i>, <i>In the Country of Last Things</i>, <i>Moon Palace</i>, <i>The Music of Chance</i>, and <i>Leviathan</i>.<br /><br />This volume includes contributions from Pascal Bruckner, Marc Chenetier, Norman Finkelstein, Derek Rubin, Madeleine Sorapure, Stephen Bernstein, Tim Woods, Steven Weisenburger, Arthur Saltzman, Eric Wirth, and Motoyuki Shibata. The extensive bibliography, prepared by William Drenttel, will greatly benefit both scholars and general readers."
Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,,Jared Diamond,eng,1041106,,Penguin Books Ltd. (London),608,273132,Civilizations Rise and Fall,2,"Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, <i>Collapse</i> is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?<br /><br />In his million-copy bestseller <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, Jared Diamond examined how and why Western civilizations developed the technologies and immunities that allowed them to dominate much of the world. Now in this brilliant companion volume, Diamond probes the other side of the equation: What caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin, and what can we learn from their fates?<br /><br />As in <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global thesis through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Moving from the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of catastrophe. Environmental damage, climate change, rapid population growth, and unwise political choices were all factors in the demise of these societies, but other societies found solutions and persisted. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our own society's apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana.<br /><br />Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, <i>Collapse</i> is destined to take its place as one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid committing ecological suicide?"

"Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse, 1970-2000",,Stephen Kotkin,,4747,,"Oxford University Press, USA",245,,,,"In the Cold War era that dominated the second half of the twentieth century, nobody envisaged that the collapse of the Soviet Union would come from within, still less that it would happen meekly, without global conflagration.<br /> In this brilliantly compact, original, engaging book, Stephen Kotkin shows that the Soviet collapse resulted not from military competition but, ironically, from the dynamism of Communist ideology, the long-held dream for ""socialism with a human face."" The neo-liberal reforms in post-Soviet Russia never took place, nor could they have, given the Soviet-era inheritance in the social, political, and economic landscape. Kotkin takes us deep into post-Stalin Soviet society and institutions, into the everyday hopes and secret political intrigues that affected 285 million people, before and after 1991. He conveys the high drama of a superpower falling apart while armed to the teeth with millions of loyal troops and tens of thousands of weapons of mass destruction. Armageddon Averted vividly demonstrates the overriding importance of history, individual ambition, geopolitics, and institutions, and deftly draws out contemporary Russia's contradictory predicament."

Searching for Lost City: On the Trail of America's Native Languages,,Elizabeth Seay,,4752,,Lyons Press,272,,,,"First Prize Multicultural Non-Fiction, The Independent Publishers Book Awards<br /><br />Choctaw, Creek, Sioux, Cherokee, and Ponca are just a few of the Native American tribal languages that are quickly moving towards extinction, down from the nearly six hundred that once existed. Experts predict that the number could drop to twenty by the middle of the century. Before they disappear completely, journalist Elizabeth Seay set out to track down what is left of these languages in her native Oklahoma. Her deeply felt narrative opens a window onto the quirks and intricacies of each language she encountered--and allows a glimpse into the last days of a vanishing culture.<br /><br />Seay finds a ""lost city"": Ross Mountain, a secret community in the Ozark Mountains where 90 percent of the people, from young to old, speak a Cherokee dialect as their first language. She meets leaders in the Indian community, from Toby Hughes, who weaves spells, to Charles Chibitty, the last Comanche code talker, and his granddaughter Lacey, for whom being a Comanche seems to be a weekend hobby. The result of Seay's journey is less a study in linguistics than a lively history lesson in cultural migration, forced assimilation, and the meaning of language itself. <br />"

They used a language composed of gestures made almost entirely with the hands and fingers, probably the most highly developed gesture language to be found in any part of the world.<br />With this book, you will find it simple to use this language, which the author learned in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, principally from Sioux Indians in Wyoming. Drawings and short descriptions make clear the proper positions and motions of the hands to convey the meaning of over 870 alphabetically arranged common words — hungry, camp, evening, angry, fire, laugh, owl, cat, many times, brave, cold, heart, rain, spotted, together, river, etc. The words are then used in sample sentences. There are also brief sections on the pictography and ideography of the Sioux and Ojibway tribes, and on smoke signals.<br />This is a book for anyone who wants to learn or teach Indian sign language — scouts, school teachers, camp counselors, scout leaders, parents, linguists, and students of Indian culture. To help counselors and teachers, the last chapters give instructions on how to conduct the Indian ceremony for opening a council fire, an Indian initiation ceremony, and suggestions for sign language tests and exercises."

Following in the footsteps of the editor's first book in the series, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature, Dr. Tom Valone's book chronologically traces the original intention that Nikola Tesla had for his wireless electricity and how he updated and expanded upon it later on, with reprints of his key articles, to the recent genius engineers and physicists who are now finally bringing this last and most elusive, highly advanced Tesla technology into reality. The Corum article (along with the Peterson article) on the Zenneck wave transmission experiments culminates the viewpoints of all of the book's contributors. Its purposeful placement as the last chapter of the book, is because this exclusive article publication is a major scientific breakthrough, as testified by the book's endorsement from Brigadier General Michael Miller, and foretells the understandable, visionary road to the corporate formation of wireless power utilities. Furthermore, this is the first and only book in the world which explains how an electromagnetic wave traveling across the electrically conductive surface of the earth, was predicted by Tesla and Zenneck (two pictures in the book show them together on pages 74 and 381) and why it is the essential missing link of any Tesla wireless transmission theory. Many of the contributors also nicely explain the ""surface wave phenomenon"" as well as ""resonant earth-ionosphere"" modes of electrical transmission without wires that compliments the surface wave theory and experiment. Nikola Tesla's Electricity Unplugged therefore is a treasure compared to any other Tesla reference book currently in print, since it is jam-packed with personal stories of Tesla, such as one reprinted from the prestigious Smithsonian magazine, along with great illustrated slideshows adapted for the book format, the ""secret"" history of Tesla's wireless, the real Tesla electric car, high Q resonant power transfer examples being used today by Qualcomm, ""Tesla unplugged"" explained in an easy-to-understand presentation by a Brookhaven National Lab scientist, wireless electricity article based on scalar waves, even including a couple amazing rigorous equation articles with wireless solutions for the tech audience, a unique and evocative Foreword by Nikola Tesla's last living direct descendant, all presented in a 457-page paperback book, suitable as a college or high school reader, or simply as an eye-opening, optimistic window onto the electrical genius regarded as the ""Master of Lightning,"" with a priceless collection of nineteen (19) contributors not available anywhere else."

The Invention of Peace: Reflections on War and International Order,,Michael Eliot Howard,,4767,,Yale University Press,128,,,,"Throughout history the overwhelming majority of human societies have taken war for granted and made it the basis for their legal and social structures. Not until the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century did war come to be regarded as an unmitigated evil and one that could be abolished by rational social organization, and only after the massive slaughter of the two world wars did this become the declared objective of civilized states. Nevertheless, war in one form or another continues unabated. In this elegantly written book, a preeminent military historian considers why this is so.<br /><br /> Is war in some sense still a necessary element in international order? Are war and peace in fact complementary? Does not peace itself breed the conditions that will ultimately lead to war? And if nuclear weapons have made war ultimately suicidal for mankind, what can be done about it? Having devoted half a century largely to studying these questions, Michael Howard offers us his reflections. Unless they can be answered, he notes, the twenty-first century is unlikely to be any more peaceful than the centuries that preceded it."

Abridged.,Penguin,,,,,"<i>Lord of the Flies </i>, William Golding's classic tale about a group of English schoolboys who are plane-wrecked on a deserted island, is just as chilling and relevant today as when it was first published in 1954. At first, the stranded boys cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain signal fires. Overseeing their efforts are Ralph, ""the boy with fair hair,"" and Piggy, Ralph's chubby, wisdom-dispensing sidekick whose thick spectacles come in handy for lighting fires. Although Ralph tries to impose order and delegate responsibility, there are many in their number who would rather swim, play, or hunt the island's wild pig population. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored or challenged outright. His fiercest antagonist is Jack, the redheaded leader of the pig hunters, who manages to lure away many of the boys to join his band of painted savages. The situation deteriorates as the trappings of civilization continue to fall away, until Ralph discovers that instead of being hunters, he and Piggy have become the hunted: ""He forgot his words, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet."" Golding's gripping novel explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition. --<i>Jennifer Hubert</i>"
A War Like No Other: How the Athenians & Spartans Fought the Peloponnesian War,,Victor Davis Hanson,eng,4791,,Random House,397,,,,"Provocative military historian Victor Davis Hanson has given painstakingly researched &amp; pathbreaking accounts of wars ranging from classical antiquity to the 21st century. Now he juxtaposes an ancient conflict with modern concerns to create his most engrossing work to date, A War Like No Other. Over the course of a generation, the Hellenic poleis of Athens &amp; Sparta fought a bloody conflict that resulted in the collapse of Athens &amp; the end of its golden age. Thucydides wrote the standard history of the Peloponnesian War, which has given readers throughout the ages a vivid &amp; authoritative narrative. But Hanson offers something new: a complete chronological account that reflects the political background of the time, the strategic thinking of the combatants, the misery of battle in multifaceted theaters &amp; insight into how these events echo in the present. He compellingly portrays the ways Athens &amp; Sparta fought on land &amp; sea, in city &amp; countryside, &amp; details their employment of the full scope of conventional &amp; nonconventional tactics, from sieges to targeted assassinations, torture &amp; terrorism. He also assesses the crucial roles played by warriors such as Pericles &amp; Lysander, artists, among them Aristophanes, &amp; thinkers including Sophocles &amp; Plato. Hanson’s perceptive analysis of events &amp; personalities raises many thought-provoking questions: Were Athens &amp; Sparta like America &amp; Russia, two superpowers battling to the death? Is the Peloponnesian War echoed in the endless, frustrating conflicts of Vietnam, Northern Ireland &amp; the current Middle East? Or was it more like America’s own Civil War, a brutal rift that rent the fabric of a glorious society, or even this century’s “red state—blue state” schism between liberals &amp; conservatives, a cultural war that manifestly controls military policies? Hanson daringly brings the facts to life &amp; unearths the often surprising ways in which the past informs the present. Brilliantly researched, dynamically written, A War Like No Other is like no other history of this important war."
Jack: A Life Like No Other,,Geoffrey Perret,,4792,,Random House,480,,,,"Previous biographies of John F. Kennedy have been based almost entirely on newspaper files and personal recollections. Geoffrey Perret's <i>Jack</i> is both the first comprehensive one-volume biography of JFK and the first account of his life based on the extensive and important documentary record that has finally become available, including Kennedy's personal diaries, hundreds of hours of taped conversations from the White House, recently declassified government documents, extensive family correspondence, and crucial interviews sealed for nearly forty years. The result is a gripping, accurate, and ultimately moving portrait of America's most charismatic president.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> provides much-needed context and perspective on Kennedy's bewilderingly complex personality. It offers an even-handed account of the seamy side of his life - orgies and abortions, health and drug problems-along with valuable insights into JFK's truly idealistic and visionary character.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> presents a compelling account of the volatile relationship between Kennedy and his wife, including Jackie's attempt to divorce him, move to Hollywood, and become a film star. At the same time Perret explains how, together, they created the Kennedy style.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> reveals how the restless, innovative Kennedy was able to overturn more than a hundred years of political tradition, forge the modern political campaign, and, once in the White House, modernize the presidency. His success was so complete that all serious presidential candidates since 1960 have sought to compare themselves to JFK, not challenging his legacy but embracing it.<br /><br /><i>Jack</i> is filled, too, with numerous revelations, such as the true story behind the lobotomy of JFK's sister Rosemary. And here, for the first time, is a comprehensive account of Kennedy's numerous and varied ailments from childhood on, including his back problems.<br /><br />Perret describes how JFK got the two most important decisions of his administration right: his handling of the Cuban missile crisis and his stance on civil rights. As to Vietnam, Kennedy did not believe it was worth fighting for, and in the last months of his presidency he began formulating a secret plan for neutralization and withdrawal-if he won the 1964 election. But that, of course, was not to be: Convinced he would die young, Kennedy foresaw that a violent death would claim him. Throughout his brief time in the White House he was haunted by a vision of a man standing at a window, looking down at him, holding a rifle.<br /><br /><i>Jack: A Life Like No Other</i> is a book like no other. Here, at last, John F. Kennedy seems to step off the page in all his vitality, charm, and originality."

And since it is inevitable that a gentleman will dabble in the friskier areas of excess, trouble, and chance, the book's naughty nucleus, ‚ÄúThe Potent Gentleman,‚Äù explores leisure and dalliance, from alcohol and snuff to recreational botanicals and sex.All men aspire to be perpetually dapper, fluent in three languages, and hit 300-yard drives off the blue tees, not to mention quote poetry by the stanza and win a back-alley scrap. However, there is a dashing plateau more desirable than Hollywood perfection, a level of gallantry that makes one stand out, even in the elevator.

Reviving a thousand-year tradition of chivalry, honor, and heroism, The Compleat Gentleman provides the essential model for twenty-first-century masculinity.<br /><br />Despite our confusion, real manhood is not complicated. It is an ancient ideal based on service to one's God, country, family, and friends--a simple but arduous ideal worthy of a lifetime of struggle. Miner's gentleman stands out for his dignity, restraint, and discernment. He rejects the notion that one way of behaving is as good as another. He belongs to an aristocracy of virtue, not of wealth or birth. Proposing neither a club nor a movement, Miner describes a lofty code of manly conduct, which, far from threatening democracy, is necessary for its survival.<br /><br />Miner traces the concept of manliness from the jousting fields of the twelfth century to the decks of the Titanic. The three masculine archetypes that emerge--the warrior, the lover, and the monk--all come together to make up the character of the compleat gentleman. This modern knight cultivates a martial spirit in defense of the true and the beautiful. He treats the opposite sex with the passionate respect required by courtly love. And he values learning in the pursuit of truth--all with the discretion, decorum, and nonchalance that the Renaissance called sprezzatura.<br /><br />The Compleat Gentleman is filled with examples from the past and the present of the man our increasingly uncivilized age demands."

The result is astonishing.</p><p>382282335X The passing of every old man or woman means the passing of some tradition, some knowledge of sacred rites possessed by no other; consequently the information that is to be gathered, for the benefit of future generations, respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost for all time. </p><p>At the turn of the century the American photographer Edward Sheriff Curtis (1868-1952) started on his thirty year project to produce a monumental study of North American Indians. Using an approach that was both artistically and scientifically ambitious he recorded, in words and pictures, the traces of the traditional Indian way of life that was already beginning to die out. </p><p>With tireless personal commitment Curtis visited American Indian tribes from the Mexican border to the Bering Straits, gaining their confidence by his patience and sensitivity. This, his photographiclife's work, was printed in 20 volumes between 1907 and 1930 as The North American Indian. The quality of reproduction of the photographs was excellent. There were only 272 copies in total. Now all his photographs are fully reproduced in this one book, together with a selection of pictures from Curtis' texts.</p>"

He drove a rental car from New York to Rhode Island to Georgia to Mississippi to Iowa to Minneapolis to Fargo to Seattle, and he chased death and rock ‘n’ roll all the way. Within the span of twenty-one days, Chuck had three relationships end—one by choice, one by chance, and one by exhaustion. He snorted cocaine in a graveyard. He walked a half-mile through a bean field. A man in Dickinson, North Dakota, explained to him why we have fewer windmills than we used to. He listened to the KISS solo albums and the Rod Stewart box set. At one point, poisonous snakes became involved. The road is hard. From the Chelsea Hotel to the swampland where Lynyrd Skynyrd’s plane went down to the site where Kurt Cobain blew his head off, Chuck explored every brand of rock star demise. He wanted to know why the greatest career move any musician can make is to stop breathing...and what this means for the rest of us."

With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And don't even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. <br /><br />Whether deconstructing <i>Saved by the Bell</i> episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he'll make you laugh, and he'll drive you insane -- usually all at once. <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i> is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but -- really -- it's about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, ""In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever 'in and of itself.'""

Coyle takes these potentially confusing and politically rife issues and makes them straightforward, thereby educating the reader in an entertaining and sophisticated manner. Coyle uses humour and irony to explain the issues. Who else could draw a link between Japanese teenage fashion and the country's long standing liquidity trap; or how sunspots can determine whether we will have a financial crisis on earth; or how pork belly futures depend on the weather and pigs' amorous intentions? Throughout the book, Diane Coyle highlights the fact that above all, economics is a social science, and one that affects us all."

"Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market",,Eric Schlosser,eng,1314875,,Houghton Mifflin Company,310,,,,"In Reefer Madness, the best-selling author of Fast Food Nation investigates America's black market and its far-reaching influence on our society through three of its mainstays -- pot, porn, and illegal immigrants. The underground economy is vast; it comprises perhaps 10 percent -- perhaps more -- of America's overall economy, and it's on the rise. Eric Schlosser charts this growth, and finds its roots in the nexus of ingenuity, greed, idealism, and hypocrisy that is American culture. He reveals the fascinating workings of the shadow economy by focusing on marijuana, one of the nation's largest cash crops; pornography, whose greatest beneficiaries include Fortune 100 companies; and illegal migrant workers, whose lot often resembles that of medieval serfs.<br /><br />All three industries show how the black market has burgeoned over the past three decades, as America's reckless faith in the free market has combined with a deep-seated puritanism to create situations both preposterous and tragic. Through pot, porn, and migrants, Schlosser traces compelling parallels between underground and overground: how tycoons and gangsters rise and fall, how new technology shapes a market, how government intervention can reinvigorate black markets as well as mainstream ones, how big business learns -- and profits -- from the underground.<br /><br />With intrepid reportage, rich history, and incisive argument, Schlosser illuminates the shadow economy and the culture that casts that shadow. <br />(front flap)<br /><br />Interior ISBN=0618334661<br />Back cover ISBN=0965762645"

When no one outside of inner-city New York had even heard of hip-hop, Simmons saw the seeds of a global force that would change the way people talk, dress, listen to music, and choose the heroes they hang on their walls. Today, he oversees a sprawling, multimillion-dollar empire of culture-defining businesses in everything from music to fashion, advertising to film, and media to visual art. At the same time he’s broadened his interests and influence and pushed hip-hop to new plateaus of power and relevance. <b>Life and Def</b> is a one-of-a-kind tale that interweaves the remarkable journey of Russell Simmons with the story of the culture he’s transformed and been transformed by. <br /><br />In his own brash, compelling voice, Simmons chronicles his numerous business successes and occasional failures. He tells the story of the founding of the legendary Def Jam Records, whose roster stretches from original rap icons like L.L. Cool J, Public Enemy, and the Beastie Boys to today’s top stars, including Jay-Z and DMX. He traces the launching of Def Comedy Jam, the long-running hit television series that introduced a new generation of black comedic stars to America, from Martin Lawrence and Bill Bellamy to Bernie Mac and Chris Rock. He spins hilarious tales of his adventures in Hollywood, where he’s produced hit movies like Eddie Murphy’s The Nutty Professor and worked with quirky geniuses like Abel Ferrara. He also tells the story of Phat Farm, the wildly successful pioneering urban clothing label whose origins lay in Russell’s longtime fascination with fashion (and fashion models).<br /><br />Simmons’s story is also one of personal transformation, from the driven man who in the heady days of early success indulged himself with drugs, sex, and world-class decadence to the husband and father he is today, a man who has found meaning in activism, philanthropy, and spiritual practice while never losing his passion for the social, political, artistic, and commercial potential of hip-hop.<br /><br />Through it all he relates telling anecdotes about the characters he’s dealt with: models and gangsters, street poets and gurus, and major players like Donald Trump, Sean Combs, Jon Peters, and Tupac Shakur. Full of advice, opinions, and behind-the-scenes scoop, <b>Life and Def</b> is the story of the quintessential hip-hop life.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

Corporate Vices: What's Gone Wrong with Business?,,Charles Cohen,,4859,,Capstone,148,,,,"Corporate Vices uncovers the real performance gap in modern corporations between good business practice that builds companies, and bad corporate habits that eventually bring them down. It builds a detailed picture of how wayward corporations often try too hard, think too little, and forget too much. And it offers a sharp contrast with companies, large and small, that are good businesses, and how they manage to stay that way.<br /><br /> Looking behind the headlines of spectacular corporate disasters, such as Enron and Marconi, as well as corporations that are under pressure and going nowhere, Corporate Vices identifies the common theme of badly run companies, that they fail to realise, or just forget, the importance of business basics, such as productivity, as they explore ever more sophisticated and expensive ways of satisfying other more immediate, like keeping cash profits high to satisfy shareholders - even at the expense of productivity. Corporate Vices explores the complex roots and the story of how corporations have allowed themselves to turn business logic on its head with such ease.<br /><br /> Corporate Vices puts an alternative way of running companies on the table in its many examples of good businesses. These are companies that manage to keep their eye on the ball, even at a price: not achieving corporate glory, turning down the latest technology, and opportunities to enter new markets.<br /><br /> Most of all, Corporate Vices makes it clear how to spot the difference, and then to fix it. It asks the questions, which everyone stuck in a bad company can't seem to answer, like, <br /> * Where did we start to go wrong?<br /> * What does the CEO think he's doing?<br /> * Why can't anyone make a decision any more?<br /> * Whose idea was this merger?"

No Logo,,Naomi Klein,eng,621375,,,,,,,"With a new Afterword to the 2002 edition, <i>No Logo</i> employs journalistic savvy and personal testament to detail the insidious practices and far-reaching effects of corporate marketing—and the powerful potential of a growing activist sect that will surely alter the course of the 21st century. First published before the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, this is an infuriating, inspiring, and altogether pioneering work of cultural criticism that investigates money, marketing, and the anti-corporate movement.<br /><br />As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toe—witness today's schoolbooks, superstores, sporting arenas, and brand-name synergy—a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons. In this provocative, well-written study, a front-line report on that battle, we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labor, how teenaged McDonald's workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters, and how ""culture jammers"" utilize spray paint, computer-hacking acumen, and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads (as in ""Joe Chemo"" for ""Joe Camel"").<br /><br /><i>No Logo</i> will challenge and enlighten students of sociology, economics, popular culture, international affairs, and marketing.<br /><br />""This book is not another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths that have gathered to form our de facto global government. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze and document the forces opposing corporate rule, and to lay out the particular set of cultural and economic conditions that made the emergence of that opposition inevitable."" —Naomi Klein, from her Introduction"

In 'The Kreutzer Sonata' he gives us a terrifying study of marital breakdown, in 'The Devil' a powerful depiction of the power of sexual temptation, and, in perhaps the finest of all, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich', he portrays the long agony of a man gradually coming to terms with his own mortality.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ISBN 1840224533 <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18384.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich_and_Other_Stories"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>.</i>"

Greater than a historical chronicle, War and Peace is an affirmation of life itself, `a complete picture', as a contemporary reviewer put it, `of everything in which people find their happiness and greatness, their grief and humiliation'. Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'."
Tolstoy Lied: A Love Story,,Rachel Kadish,,1569873,,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,336,,,,"Tolstoy famously wrote, “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” To Tracy Farber, thirty-three, happily single, headed for tenure at a major university, and content to build a life around friends and work, this celebrated maxim is questionable at best. Because if Tolstoy is to be taken at his word, only unhappiness is interesting; happiness must be as placid and unmemorable as a daisy in a field of a thousand daisies.<br /><br />Having decided to reject the petty indignities of dating, Tracy focuses instead on her secret project: to determine whether happiness can be interesting, in literature and in life, or whether it can be -- must be -- a plant with thorns and gnarled roots. It's an unfashionable proposition, and a potential threat to her job security. But Tracy is her own best example of a happy and interesting life. Little does she know, however, that her best proof will come when she falls for George, who will challenge all of her old assumptions, as love proves to be even more complicated than she had imagined. Can this young feminist scholar, who posits that ""a woman's independence is a hothouse flower -- improbable, rare, requiring vigilance,"" find happiness in a way that fulfills both her head and her heart?<br /><br />Love may be the ultimate cliché, but in Rachel Kadish’s hands, it is also a morally serious question, deserving of our sober attention as well as our delighted laughter."

The culmination of a lifetime's thought, it espouses a commitment to Jesus's message of turning the other cheek. In a bold and original manner, Tolstoy shows his readers clearly why they must reject violence of any sort—even that sanctioned by the state or the church—and urges them to look within themselves to find the answers to questions of morality.<br />In 1894, one of the first English translations of this book found its way into the hands of a young Gandhi. Inspired by its message of nonresistance to evil, the Mahatma declared it a source of ""independent thinking, profound morality, and truthfulness."" Much of this work's emotional and moral appeal lies in its emphasis on fair treatment of the poor and working class. Its view of Christianity, not as a mystic religion but as a workable philosophy originating from the words of a remarkable teacher, extends its appeal to secular and religious readers alike."
Walk in the Light & Twenty-Three Tales,,Leo Tolstoy,,1686403,,Orbis Books,351,,,,"Uncluttered by the complexities of plot and character that daunt so many readers of the longer Russian masterpieces, Tolstoy's tales illumine eternal truths with the forceful brevity. While inspired by the sense of spiritual certainty, their narrative quality, subtle humor, and visionary power lift them far above the common run of ""religious"" literature."
The Poet of Tolstoy Park,,Sonny Brewer,,14719,,Ballantine Books,254,,,,"“The more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death.” Leo Tolstoy spoke these words, and they became Henry Stuart’s raison d’etre. <i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is the unforgettable novel based on the true story of Henry Stuart’s life, which was reclaimed from his doctor’s belief that he would not live another year.<br /><br />Henry responds to the news by slogging home barefoot in the rain. It’s 1925. The place: Canyon County, Idaho. Henry is sixty-seven, a retired professor and a widower who has been told a warmer climate would make the end more tolerable. San Diego would be a good choice. <br /><br />Instead, Henry chose Fairhope, Alabama, a town with utopian ideals and a haven for strong-minded individualists. Upton Sinclair, Sherwood Anderson, and Clarence Darrow were among its inhabitants. Henry bought his own ten acres of piney woods outside Fairhope. Before dying, underscored by the writings of his beloved Tolstoy, Henry could begin to “perfect the soul awarded him” and rest in the faith that he, and all people, would succeed, “even if it took eons.” Human existence, Henry believed, continues in a perfect circle unmarred by flaws of personality, irrespective of blood and possessions and rank, and separate from organized religion. In Alabama, until his final breath, he would chase these high ideas.<br /><br />But first, Henry had to answer up for leaving Idaho. Henry’s dearest friend and intellectual sparring partner, Pastor Will Webb, and Henry’s two adult sons, Thomas and Harvey, were baffled and angry that he would abandon them and move to the Deep South, living in a barn there while he built a round house of handmade concrete blocks. His new neighbors were perplexed by his eccentric behavior as well. On the coldest day of winter he was barefoot, a philosopher and poet with ideas and words to share with anyone who would listen. And, mysteriously, his “last few months” became years. He had gone looking for a place to learn lessons in dying, and, studiously advanced to claim a vigorous new life.<br /><br /><i>The Poet of Tolstoy Park </i>is a moving and irresistible story, a guidebook of the mind and spirit that lays hold of the heart. Henry Stuart points the way through life’s puzzles for all of us, becoming in this timeless tale a character of such dimension that he seems more alive now than ever.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

Based directly on Frank Herbert's final outline, which lay hidden in a safe-deposit box for a decade, these two volumes will finally answer the urgent questions Dune fans have been debating for two decades.At the end of Chapterhouse: Dune-Frank Herbert's final novel--a ship carrying the ghola of Duncan Idaho, Sheeana (a young woman who can control sandworms), and a crew of various refugees escapes into the uncharted galaxy, fleeing from the monstrous Honored Matres, dark counterparts to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. The nearly invincible Honored Matres have swarmed into the known universe, driven from their home by a terrifying, mysterious Enemy. As designed by the creative genius of Frank Herbert, the primary story of Hunters and Sandworms is the exotic odyssey of Duncan's no-ship as it is forced to elude the diabolical traps set by the ferocious, unknown Enemy. To strengthen their forces, the fugitives have used genetic technology from Scytale, the last Tleilaxu Master, to revive key figures from Dune's past-including Paul Muad'Dib and his beloved Chani, Lady Jessica, Stilgar, Thufir Hawat, and even Dr. Wellington Yueh. Each of these characters will use their special talents to meet the challenges thrown at them.Failure is unthinkable--not only is their survival at stake, but they hold the fate of the entire human race in their hands."

Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great ""we"" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--""I."""

Sailing from Byzantium: How a Lost Empire Shaped the World,,Colin  Wells,eng,4923,,Delacorte Press,335,,,,"A gripping intellectual adventure story, Sailing from Byzantium sweeps you from the deserts of Arabia to the dark forests of northern Russia, from the colorful towns of Renaissance Italy to the final moments of a millennial city under siege.... <br />Byzantium: the successor of Greece and Rome, this magnificent empire bridged the ancient and modern worlds for more than a thousand years. Without Byzantium, the works of Homer and Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle, Sophocles and Aeschylus, would never have survived. Yet very few of us have any idea of the enormous debt we owe them. <br />The story of Byzantium is a real-life adventure of electrifying ideas, high drama, colorful characters, and inspiring feats of daring. In Sailing from Byzantium, Colin Wells tells of the missionaries, mystics, philosophers, and artists who against great odds and often at peril of their own lives spread Greek ideas to the Italians, the Arabs, and the Slavs. <br />Their heroic efforts inspired the Renaissance, the golden age of Islamic learning, and Russian Orthodox Christianity, which came complete with a new alphabet, architecture, and one of the world's greatest artistic traditions. <br />The story's central reference point is an arcane squabble called the Hesychast controversy that pitted humanist scholars led by the brilliant, acerbic intellectual Barlaam against the powerful monks of Mount Athos led by the stern Gregory Palamas, who denounced ""pagan"" rationalism in favor of Christian mysticism. <br />Within a few decades, the light of Byzantium would be extinguished forever by the invading Turks, but not before the humanists found a safe haven for Greek literature. The controversy of rationalism versus faith would continue to be argued by some of history's greatest minds. <br />Fast-paced, compulsively readable, and filled with fascinating insights, Sailing from Byzantium is one of the great historical dramas-the gripping story of how the flame of civilization was saved and passed on."

David Carson 2ndsight,,Lewis Blackwell,,36290,,Universe,176,,,,"2ndsight is the sequel to The End of Print, the first monograph on David Carson's work. While The End of Print showed the world Carson's radical new approach, his rejection of the traditional 'rules' of communication, 2ndsight examines the creative process behind the work, and considers the broader implications of his intuitive approach to graphic design. Intuition is central to the book's thesis, and its meaning and influence is explored both in Lewis Blackwell's writing and in the evocative texts by leading designers and thinkers interspersed throughout the book. As well as presenting Carson's commercial work - his latest ideas in advertising, magazine and book design, web sites, film and video - 2ndsight examines work inspired by exhibitions, talks and workshops. The student workshops Carson conducts in design colleges around the world throw particular light on his creative process. The workings of these sessions are examined: their chief aim being not to teach computer skills or encourage participants to mimic the master, but to help them find their own voice. Finally, a conversation between Blackwell and Carson probes Carson's working methods - his collage technique of using two or more files at once on screen; of working in black and white; of moving to and from the computer, printing out each stage of a design before developing it further; his experimentation with the balance of type and image. Above all, his respect for intuition and his conviction that it is the key to truly individual graphic expression."

After the babies from distant Asia are delivered, Bitsy Donaldson impulsively invites the Yazdans to celebrate with an “arrival party,” an event that is repeated every year as the two families become more deeply intertwined.<br /><br />Even independent-minded Maryam is drawn in. But only up to a point. When she finds herself being courted by one of the Donaldson clan, a good-hearted man of her vintage, recently widowed and still recovering from his wife’s death, suddenly all the values she cherishes—her traditions, her privacy, her otherness—are threatened. Somehow this big American takes up so much space that the orderly boundaries of her life feel invaded.<br /><br />A luminous novel brimming with subtle, funny, and tender observations that cast a penetrating light on the American way as seen from two perspectives, those who are born here and those who are still struggling to fit in."

Shortly thereafter, he negotiates a cordial ""understanding"" with Adolf Hitler, while the new government embarks on a program of folksy anti-Semitism.<br /><br />For one boy growing up in Newark, Lindbergh's election is the first in a series of ruptures that threatens to destroy his small, safe corner of America - and with it, his mother, his father, and his older brother.<br />(back cover)"
Covenant with Black America,,Tavis Smiley,,4950,,Third World Press,254,,,,"Six years' worth of symposiums come together in this rich collection of essays that plot a course for African Americans, explaining how individuals and households can make changes that will immediately improve their circumstances in areas ranging from health and education to crime reduction and financial well-being. Addressing these pressing concerns are contributors Dr. David Satcher, former U.S. surgeon general; Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; Angela Glover Blackwell, founder of the research think tank PolicyLink; and Cornell West, professor of Religion at Princeton University. Each chapter outlines one key issue and provides a list of resources, suggestions for action, and a checklist for what concerned citizens can do to keep their communities progressing socially, politically, and economically. Though the African American community faces devastating social disparities—in which more than 8 million people live in poverty—this celebration of possibility, hope, and strength will help leaders and citizens keep Black America moving forward."

The book's enduring appeal lies in the eloquent, prophetic voice of Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859), a French aristocrat who visited the United States in 1831. A thoughtful young man in a still-young country, he succeeded in penning this penetrating study of America's people, culture, history, geography, politics, legal system, and economy. Tocqueville asserts, I confess that in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress."

"Swiss Graphic Design: The Origins and Growth of an International Style, 1920-1965",,Richard Hollis,,4955,,Yale University Press,272,,,,"Swiss graphic design and “the Swiss Style” are crucial elements in the history of modernism. During the 1920s and ’30s, skills traditionally associated with Swiss industry, particularly pharmaceuticals and mechanical engineering, were matched by those of the country’s graphic designers, who produced their advertising and technical literature. These pioneering graphic artists saw design as part of industrial production and searched for anonymous, objective visual communication. They chose photographic images rather than illustration, and typefaces that were industrial-looking rather than those designed for books.Written by noted design authority Richard Hollis, this lavishly illustrated volume looks at the uniquely clear graphic language developed by such Swiss designers as Theo Ballmer, Max Bill, Adrian Frutiger, Karl Gerstner, Armin Hoffman, Ernst Keller, Herbert Matter, Josef Müller-Brockmann, and Jan Tschichold. The style of these artists received worldwide admiration for its formal discipline: images and text were organized by geometrical grids. Adopted internationally, the grid and sans serif typefaces such as Helvetica became the classic emblems of Swiss graphic design.Showcasing design work across a range of media, including posters, magazines, exhibition displays, brochures, advertisements, books, and film, this essential book shows how many of the Swiss designers’ modernist elements remain an indispensable part of today’s graphic language."

From 260 submitting designers the jury selected 24 prizewinning projects, including garments by Lela Scherrer, Han Phu Tran, Rachel Imboden, and Daniel Hermann, photographs by Glan Paolo Minelli and Ruth Erdt, paper by Happypets Products, an electric comfort mattress pad by Simone Luling, illustrations by Anne Crausaz, and book packages by Gilles Gavillet.

Evocative of the great Ajahn Chah, her teachings are earthy, refreshingly direct, and hard-hitting. In the twentieth century, she grew to become one of the most famous teachers in Thailand--male or female--all the more remarkable because, rarer still, she was not a monastic but a layperson. Her relentless honesty, along with her encouraging voice, is one reason so many contemporary Buddhist teachers recall Upasika Kee so fondly, and so often. With this book, readers seeking something reminiscent of the classic <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> can receive instruction on meditation practice as they become acquainted with the legacy of a renowned Buddhist figure. <i>Pure and Simple</i>, the first widely-available collection of her writings, will be gratefully received not only by those who knew Upasika Kee, but by anyone who encounters her for the first time in its pages."

In Buddhism Plain and Simple, Steve Hagen presents these uncluttered, original teachings in everyday, accessible language unencumbered by religious ritual, tradition, or belief."

As their legend grew, they became known as the Shaolin Fighting Monks, revered across the land for their spiritual dedication, enlightened message, and amazing fighting skills.<br /><br />DeMasco entered the Shaolin Temple to battle the demons of his past. But he got more than he bargained for. Besides learning how to wield weapons and take on multiple attackers at once, he discovered an ancient philosophy that helped melt away preconceived notions of the world, and gave him a powerful platform on which to live and grow. In <em>The Shaolin Way</em>, he adapts these teachings for the modern world, singling out ten secrets of survival that can help anyone live a more fulfilled life."

As the St. Louis Cardinals battle their archrival Chicago Cubs, we watch from the dugout through the eyes of legendary manager Tony La Russa, considered by many to be the shrewdest mind in the game today. In his twenty-seven years of managing, La Russa has been named Manager of the Year a record-making five times and now stands as the third-winningest baseball manager of all time. A great leader, he's built his success on the conviction that ball games are won not only by the numbers but also by the hearts and minds of those who play.<br /><br />Drawing on unprecedented access to a major league manager and his team, Buzz Bissinger brings a revelatory intimacy to baseball and offers some surprising observations.

Cryptonomicon,,Neal Stephenson,eng,1166797,,Avon,1152,,,,"<i>Cryptonomicon</i> zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods—World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.""<br /><br />All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties."

Ces trois destins croisés, éloignés autant dans le temps que dans l'échelle sociale, semblent pourtant converger, dans ce premier volume, vers un étrange trésor de guerre japonais englouti dans le pacifique. Avec comme thème central l'information et la désinformation en temps de guerre militaire ou économique, ce livre est un véritable pont entre les genres : romans de guerre, d'espionnage et de SF. <i>--Laurent Schneitter</i></p>"

Das Buch hat die konventionellen Vorstellungen der High-Tech-Zukunft derart neu definiert, dass es zu einer sich selbst bewahrheitenden Voraussage wurde. Wenn dieser Cyberpunk-Klassiker groß war, dann ist <i>Cryptonomicon</i> riesig, enorm, gewaltig -- nicht nur aufgrund seines schieren Umfangs (circa 900 Seiten), sondern auch in seinem Reiz. Es ist der zeitgemäße, lesenswerte Nachfolger von <i>Die Enden der Parabel</i> und der <i>Illuminatus</i>-Trilogie. Darüber hinaus ist es auch das erste Buch einer geplanten Serie.<p> <i>Cryptonomicon</i> zoomt durch die ganze Welt und rast verschwörerisch zwischen zwei Zeiten hin und her -- dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und der Gegenwart. Die zwei Helden aus den 40er-Jahren sind der glänzende Mathematiker Lawrence Waterhouse, ein außerordentlicher Kryptoanalytiker, und der übereifrige, morphiumsüchtige Bobby Shaftoe von den US-Marines. Sie gehören zum Sonderkommando 2702, einer Alliiertengruppe, die versucht, die Kommunikationskodes der Achsenmächte zu knacken. Gleichzeitig ist sie bemüht zu verhindern, dass der Feind dahinter kommt, dass ihre eigenen Kodes bereits geknackt sind. Unter dem Strich besteht ihre Aufgabe aus einer Täuschung nach der anderen. Dr. Alan Turing, der ebenfalls zum Sonderkommando 2702 gehört, erklärt Waterhouse die seltsame Arbeitsweise der Einheit: ""Wenn wir einen Konvoi versenken wollen, schicken wir erst ein Beobachtungsflugzeug hinaus... Das Observieren ist natürlich nicht seine eigentliche Aufgabe -- wir wissen schon längst, wo sich der Konvoi befindet. Seine eigentliche Aufgabe besteht darin, selbst beobachtet zu werden... wenn wir dann kommen, um sie zu versenken, schöpfen die Deutschen keinen Verdacht.""</p><p> Diese ganze Geheimnistuerei spiegelt sich in der Gegenwartshandlung wider, in der sich die Enkel der Weltkriegshelden -- der unnachahmliche Programmierfreak Randy Waterhouse und die schöne und starke Amy Shaftoe -- zusammentun, um in Südostasien eine Offshore-Datenoase zu schaffen und nach Möglichkeit auch den Verbleib von Gold aufzudecken, das für die Schatulle der Nazis bestimmt war. Um den paranoiden Ton der Geschichte abzurunden, taucht der mysteriöse Enoch Root, einer der Topangehörigen des Sonderkommandos 2702 und der Societas Eruditorium, mit einem nicht dechiffrierbaren Verschlüsselungskonzept aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg auf, um die Protagonisten von 1990 mit verschwörerischen Verbindungen zu verwirren.</p><p> <i>Cryptonomicon</i> ist von der ersten bis zur letzten Seite Neal Stephenson vom Feinsten: knapp in der Handlung, aber erschöpfend präzise im Detail. Jede Seite enthält eine Mathematikaufgabe, einen zitierbaren Insider-Witz, eine faszinierende Idee oder ein Stückchen beißender Prosa. <i>Cryptonomicon</i> ist zudem voll gepackt mit wahrhaft seltsamen Figuren -- irren Technologie- und Kryptofreaks und mehr Kryptologie, als man jemals brauchen wird -- vom gegenwärtigen Computerjargon einmal ganz abgesehen. Vorsicht: Wenn Sie dieses Buch in einem Zug lesen, könnten Sie einer Informationsüberlastung (und dem Hungertod) zum Opfer fallen. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"
Cryptonomicon,,Neal Stephenson,,1166797,,Arrow,918,,,,"<b>A gripping and page-turning thriller that explores themes of power, information, secrecy and war in the twentieth century. From the author of the three-volume historical epic 'The Baroque Cycle' and <i>Seveneves</i>.</b><br /><br />In his legendary, sprawling masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century.<br /><br />In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - a mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to Detachment 2702, an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists. Some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt.<br /><br />Their mission is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. Waterhouse is flung into a cryptographic chess match against his German counterpart - one where every move determines the fate of thousands.<br /><br />In the present day, Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. Joining forces with the tough-as-nails Amy, Randy attempts tosecretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat.<br /><br />But their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 - and an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. There are two ways this could go: towards unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty - or towards a totalitarian nightmare...<br /><br />Profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyperactive, <i>Cryptonomicon</i> is a work of great art, thought and creative daring, the product of a ingenious imagination working with white-hot intensity."

Une fois les délires hégémoniques balayés par la victoire américaine de 1945, reste à découvrir l'endroit où ce trésor a été enfoui, dans un lieu indiqué dans des messages interceptés soixante ans plus tôt.

While a subject such as archaeology, by its very nature, takes objects into account, other disciplines, such as psychology, emphasize internal mental structures and other non-material issues. This book brings together a team of contributors from across the social sciences who have been taking 'things' more seriously to examine how people relate to objects. The contributors focus on every day objects and how these objects enter into our activities over the course of time. Using a combination of different theoretical approaches, including actor network theory, ecological psychology, cognitive linguistics and science and technology studies, the book argues against the standard notion of objects and their properties as inert and meaningless and argues for the need to understand the relations between people and objects in terms of process and change."

What does the life of everyday objects after the check-out reveal about people and their material worlds? Has the quest for 'the real thing' become so important because the high tech world of total virtuality threatens to engulf us?<br /><br />This pioneering book bridges design theory and anthropology to offer a new and challenging way of understanding the changing meanings of contemporary human-object relations. The act of consumption is only the starting point in objects' 'lives'. Thereafter they are transformed and invested with new meanings that reflect and assert who we are. Defining design as 'things with attitude' differentiates the highly visible fashionable object from ordinary artefacts that are taken for granted. Through case studies ranging from reproduction furniture to fashion and textiles to 'clutter', the author traces the connection between objects and authenticity, ephemerality and self-identity. But beyond this, she shows the materiality of the everyday in terms of space, time and the body and suggests a transition with the passing of time from embodiment to disembodiment.<br /><br />Shortlisted for the Design History Society Scholarship Prize 2001-2002"

Self-sustaining means that the companies they started would continue to flourish without the day-to-day input of the founder. To fulfill such a qualification, the founder must have built a company consisting of a group of independent real estate entrepreneurs who are capable of managing and growing the business to the next level of success.

The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.<br /><br />But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line—somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.<br /><br />Attilius—decent, practical, and incorruptible—promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him.<br /><br />With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster."

Pompeii: Public and Private Life,,Paul Zanker,,5111,,Harvard University Press,253,,,,"Pompeii's tragedy is our windfall: an ancient city fully preserved, its urban design and domestic styles speaking across the ages. This richly illustrated book conducts us through the captured wonders of Pompeii, evoking at every turn the life of the city as it was 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />When Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. its lava preserved not only the Pompeii of that time but a palimpsest of the city's history, visible traces of the different societies of Pompeii's past. Paul Zanker, a noted authority on Roman art and architecture, disentangles these tantalizing traces to show us the urban images that marked Pompeii's development from country town to Roman imperial city. Exploring Pompeii's public buildings, its streets and gathering places, we witness the impact of religious changes, the renovation of theaters and expansion of athletic facilities, and the influence of elite families on the city's appearance. Through these stages, Zanker adeptly conjures a sense of the political and social meanings in urban planning and public architecture.<br /><br />The private houses of Pompeii prove equally eloquent, their layout, decor, and architectural detail speaking volumes about the life, taste, and desires of their owners. At home or in public, at work or at ease, these Pompeians and their world come alive in Zanker's masterly rendering. A provocative and original reading of material culture, his work is an incomparable introduction to urban life in antiquity."

Originally published in 1937, it's the timeless story of George Milton and Lennie Small, ranch hands who drift from job to job, always one step ahead of the law and a few dollars from the poorhouse. George is small, wiry, sharp-tongued and quick-tempered; slow witted Lennie is his opposite—an immense man, brutishly strong but naturally docile, a giant with the mind of a child. Despite their difference, George and Lennie are bound together by a shared vision: their own small farm, where they'll raise cows, pigs, chickens, and rabbits, where they'll be their own bosses and live off the fat of the land.<br /><br />When they find work on a ranch in California's Salinas Valley, the dream at last seems within reach. If they can just save up a little money. . . . But their hopes, like ""the best-laid schemes of mice and men,"" begin to go awry. The story unfolds with the power and inevitability of a Greek tragedy, as Lennie commits an accidental murder, and George, in a riveting, deeply moving finale, must do what he can to make things turn our right."

If so, take heart: all research indicates that the most significant influence on the life of a teenager comes from his or her parents. Yes--parents! In this updated volume, marriage and family expert Dr. Gary Chapman lays out the tools you need to communicate with your teenager. As Dr. Chapman states, ""At the root of much teenage misbehavior is a teen's empty love tank. I am not suggesting that parents do not love their teenagers; I am suggesting that thousands of teenagers do not feel that love. For most parents, it is not a matter of sincerity but rather lack of information on how to communicate love effectively on an emotional level.""

You'll learn how to identify your teenager's love language, how to address their unique need for independence and responsibility, how to combat anger and set up boundaries, and how to best parent your teenager if you are a single parent or a blended family."

In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their ""love tank."" Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice. <p> How do you discover your spouse's - and your own - love language? Chapman's short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out.

A chapter on the Judgment Day and the end of the world explores portrayals of the mysterious worlds between life and death and in the afterlife.

Even in the age of high-tech data collection, many businesses don't realize that some of their customers are deeply unprofitable, and that simply doing business with them is costing them money. In many places, it's typical that the top 20 percent of customers are generating almost all the profit while the bottom 20 percent are actually destroying value. Managers are missing tremendous opportunities if they are not aware which of their customers are truly profitable and which are not.<br /> <br />According to Larry Selden and Geoff Colvin, there is a way to fix this problem: manage your business not as a collection of products and services but as a customer portfolio. Selden and Colvin show readers how to analyze customer data to understand how you can get the most out of your most critical customer segments. The authors reveal how some companies (such as Best Buy and Fidelity Investments) have already moved in this direction, and what customer-centric strategies are likely to become widespread in the coming years.For corporate leaders, middle managers, or small business owners, this book offers a breakthrough plan to delight their best customers and drive shareowner value."

Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo,,Margot Mifflin,,5225,,powerHouse Books,176,,,,"""In this provocative work full of intriguing female characters from tattoo history, Margot Mifflin makes a persuasive case for the tattooed woman as an emblem of female self-expression."" <br />--Susan Faludi <br /> ""Bodies of Subversion"" is the first history of women's tattoo art, providing a fascinating excursion to a subculture that dates back into the nineteenth-century and includes many never-before-seen photos of tattooed women from the last century. Author Margot Mifflin notes that women's interest in tattoos surged in the suffragist 20s and the feminist 70s. She chronicles: <br />* Breast cancer survivors of the 90s who tattoo their mastectomy scars as an alternative to reconstructive surgery or prosthetics. <br />* The parallel rise of tattooing and cosmetic surgery during the 80s when women tattooists became soul doctors to a nation afflicted with body anxieties. <br />* Maud Wagner, the first known woman tattooist, who in 1904 traded a date with her tattooist husband-to-be for an apprenticeship. <br />* Victorian society women who wore tattoos as custom couture, including Winston Churchill's mother, who wore a serpent on her wrist. <br />* Nineteeth-century sideshow attractions who created fantastic abduction tales in which they claimed to have been forcibly tattooed. <br /> ""In ""Bodies of Subversion,"" Margot Mifflin insightfully chronicles the saga of skin as signage. Through compelling anecdotes and cleverly astute analysis, she shows and tells us new histories about women, tattoos, public pictures, and private parts. It's an indelible account of an indelible piece of cultural history."" <br />--Barbara Kruger, artist"
Politics of Subversion,"[{'id': '669', 'name': 'Antonio Negri', 'role': ''}, {'id': '1373082', 'name': 'James Newell', 'role': 'Translator'}]",Antonio Negri,,5226,,Polity Press,,,,,"In this important book, Antonio Negri develops the key ideas that were to form the basis for the highly influential analyses of new forms of power and social struggle presented in Empire and Multitude. He shows how new technology and the break-up of the traditional factory have created new social subjects whose value is no longer tied to their skill. The spread of communication networks and the globalization of production mean that capitalism has become totalized - but not, Negri stresses, monolithic. On the contrary, the possibilities for subversion have correspondingly increased. <br />Going beyond classical Marxism, he shows how old solidarities must be reformulated and new alliances created. The struggles which marked the political end of the twentieth century are now being repeated in a new historical conjuncture, giving rise to new forms of transnational solidarity that can challenge dominant global powers. <br />This new paperback edition, which includes a new Preface by the author, is an excellent introduction to the work of one of the most influential political thinkers writing today and will be essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the new forms of conflict and struggle that will shape the world in the twenty-first century."
Dreams of Subversion in Medieval Jewish Art and Literature,,Marc Michael Epstein,,5227,,Penn State University Press,200,,,,Europe's Jewish minority culture was subjected to a barrage of public images proclaiming the dominance of the Christian majority. This book is the first to explore the Jewish response to this assault in the development of a visual culture through which Jews could affirmatively construct their identity as a people. It demonstrates how medieval Jews gave voice to messages of protest and dreams of subversion by actively appropriating and transforming the quintessential symbols of the dominant culture.
Recovering Subversion: FEMINIST POLITICS BEYOND THE LAW,,Nivedita Menon,,27220,,University of Illinois Press,288,,,,"Is the language of rights enough to foster real social and political change? Nivedita Menon explores the relationship between law and feminist politics by examining the contemporary Indian women's movement with comparisons to France and the United States. She argues that the intersection of feminist politics, law, and the state often paradoxically and severely distorts important ethical and emancipatory impulses of feminism. Menon reviews historical challenges to the liberal notion of rights from Marxist, feminist, postcolonial, and critical legal scholars, and analyzes current Indian debates on topics including abortion, sexual violence, and Parliamentary quotas for women. Far from being a call to withdraw from the arena of law, ""Recovering Subversion"" instead urges feminists everywhere to recognize the limits of ""rights discourse"" and pleads for a politics that goes beyond its boundaries."

Read My Lips: Sexual Subversion and the tend of Gender, a frontal assault on both the status quo in academic studies and the full spectrum of single-issue identity politics, will change the way you think about bodies, sex, and gender. Yours and everyone else's.Combining the theoretical breakthroughs of Judith Butler's Gender Trouble and the performance revelations of Kate Bornstein's Gender Outlaw, Wilchins -- cofounder of the Transsexual Menace -- moves the dialogue to a new level. In a voice that is by turns outraged, outrageous, sad, and hilarious, the author weaves theory and personal experience into a compelling story of self-discovery. She redefines what it means to be ""gendered"", both by the way she lives and the accessible theoretical narrative she constructs.<br /><br />Read My Lips, with its unique mix of theory and application, anecdote and affront, will appeal to feminists, queer academics, activists, transpeople, ""the-queer-on-the-street"", and the increasing audience of mainstream readers hungry for writing that pushes the absolute edge of the gender envelope.<br /><br />OUT Magazine says that the author ""has surfaced as the Superhero of this burgeoning (transgender) movement"". Wilchins, herself, signs off on her email as follows: ""Just your average straight white guy with a cunt who really digs lezzie chicks like me"".

1776,,David McCullough,eng,3364186,US / Canada,Simon  Schuster,386,,,,"In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.<br /><br />Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, <i>1776</i> is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.<br /><br />At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.<br /><br />But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's <i>1776</i> is another landmark in the literature of American history."

From John Adams's opening diatribe to the signing of the document, 1776 is a classic musical play of mounting tension and triumph. Stone and Edwards have dramatically brought to life the legendary delegates: the ever-urbane Benjamin Franklin, the hot-blooded newlywed Thomas Jefferson, and the fiery Adams in conflict with the conservative John Dickinson.

At its height, what Schama calls the ""empire of good intentions,"" Britain controlled a quarter of the world's population. But instead of nurturing its wards in freedom and prosperity, it presided over the famines and religious furies that would undo its power. <br />At the same time, Britain was discovering itself, beginning with the Romantic genereation in the wilds of Scotland and Wales. During Queen Victoria's long reign, previously invisible and inaudible Britons-woman, the working class, the colonized-found their voice and demanded their share.

Julie and Hank's new life in the valley of Gap Creek in the last years of the nineteenth century is more complicated than the couple ever imagined.

Their struggles with nature, with work, with the changing century, and with their disappointments and triumphs make this a riveting follow-up to Morgan's acclaimed novel, The Truest Pleasure."

So it follows that if we want to be healthy, we should buy healthy foods. And for foods to be healthy, the earth they grow in also needs to be in good health. This might seem like Ecology 101, but it’s what many supermarket shoppers are grappling with nowadays as they try to decide what to feed the family.<br /><br /><i>The Eco-Foods Guide </i>is a lively conversation with consumers that takes the gloom out of our grocery choices and empowers shoppers to vote with their food dollars for the environment and for a safe future for their grandchildren. Frankenfoods and more have made food shopping so frightening and complex that the result has often been paralysis or denial. But in this optimistic and even humorous jaunt through the topic, sustainable agriculture expert Cynthia Barstow encourages readers to walk away bubbling with opportunities to buy what’s best—most of the time—and to even engage with the many others working to effect change in agriculture.<br /><br />In a straightforward style, <i>The Eco-Foods Guide </i>ex-amines the downside: pesticides and growth hormones, biotechnology and processed foods, manufacturing concentration and animal husbandry, and the overuse of nonrenewable resources. At the same time, it highlights alternatives and solutions, including:<br /><br />• Eating seasonally<br /><br />• Buying local<br /><br />• Reforming school cafeteria menus<br /><br />• Shopping at farmer’s markets<br /><br />• Eating at Chef’s Collaborative restaurants<br /><br />• Supporting labeling, organic, and IPM production methods<br /><br />• Regarding our food again as sacred<br /><br /><b>Cynthia Barstow </b>is adjunct faculty at the University of Massachusetts and an environmental/sustainable agriculture marketing consultant and speaker.

Body Brokers: Inside America's Underground Trade in Human Remains,,Annie Cheney,,5313,,Broadway,240,,,,"“You are a little soul carrying around a corpse.” —Epictetus <br />“Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will follow.” —<i>Matthew 24:28</i> <br /> <br /><i>Body Brokers</i> is an audacious, disturbing, and compellingly written investigative exposé of the lucrative business of procuring, buying, and selling human cadavers and body parts. <br /> <br />Every year human corpses meant for anatomy classes, burial, or cremation find their way into the hands of a shadowy group of entrepreneurs who profit by buying and selling human remains. While the government has controls on organs and tissue meant for transplantation, these “body brokers” capitalize on the myriad other uses for dead bodies that receive no federal oversight whatsoever: commercial seminars to introduce new medical gadgetry; medical research studies and training courses; and U.S. Army land-mine explosion tests. A single corpse used for these purposes can generate up to $10,000. <br /><br />As journalist Annie Cheney found while reporting on this subject over the course of three years, when there’s that much money to be made with no federal regulation, there are all sorts of shady (and fascinating) characters who are willing to employ questionable practices—from deception and outright theft—to acquire, market and distribute human bodies and parts. In Michigan and New York she discovers funeral directors who buy corpses from medical schools and supply the parts to surgical equipment companies and associations of surgeons. In California, she meets a crematorium owner who sold the body parts of people he was supposed to cremate, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits. In Florida, she attends a medical conference in a luxury hotel, where fresh torsos are delivered in Igloo coolers and displayed on gurneys in a room normally used for banquets. “That torso that you’re living in right now is just flesh and bones to me. To me, it’s a product,” says the New Jersey-based broker presiding over the torsos. Tracing the origins of body brokering from the “resurrectionists” of the nineteenth century to the entrepreneurs of today, Cheney chronicles how demand for cadavers has long driven unscrupulous funeral home, crematorium and medical school personnel to treat human bodies as commodities. <br /> <br />Gripping, often chilling, and sure to cause a reexamination of the American way of death,<i> Body Brokers</i> is both a captivating work of first-person reportage and a surprising inside look at a little-known aspect of the “death care” world."
"The Devil's Broker: Seeking Gold, God, and Glory in Fourteenth- Century Italy",,Frances Stonor Saunders,,5314,,Harper Perennial,416,,,,"<blockquote>A vibrant history of Italy in the cataclysmic fourteenth century as seen through the life of a brilliant military strategist and bandit lord<br /><br /></blockquote>At the dawn of the Renaissance, hordes of mercenaries swooped down on the opulent city-states of Italy and commenced to drain them dry. The greatest of all the bandits was Sir John Hawkwood, an English expatriate and military genius who formed his own army, cleverly pitted ancient rivals against one another, held the Pope for ransom, and set blood running in the streets.<br /><br />In this gripping biography of the charismatic Hawkwood, Frances Stonor Saunders illuminates the fourteenth century as a time of plague, political schism, and religious mania offset by a gargantuan appetite for spectacle and luxury. Dazzling and addictively readable, <em>The Devil's Broker</em> is a riveting account of the fortunes gained and lost in a tumultuous time."

Warren Buffett: : Master of the Market,,Jay Steele,,5339,,PerfectBound,224,,,,"Warren Buffett is known as the billionaire investment expert of the century and everyone would love to know the secret of his success. In his own words, Buffett is just a regular guy who likes fast food, honest work, and people he can trust. Throw in incredible instincts, a genius for numbers, meticulous research, and an almost sure-fire investment philosophy, and you begin to understand how he's become a legend in his own time. With just a few thousands of dollars from relatives and friends, and by taking calculated risks with small companies and staying with them, he managed, almost single-handedly, to turn Salomon Brothers around. Giants like Disney, American Express, McDonald's, Gillette, and Coca-Cola have all been affected by Buffett's magic touch, and he owns a chunk of all of them. By thirty-one, BUffett had already made himself a millionaire, and he's worked his way steadily toward the top of the Forbes list.<br /><br />Here is a fascinating portrait of Warren Buffett, known for his investigating genius, his sense of humor, and his mean turn of a phrase. It's an amazing story of a man who carved his own path through American business by doing his homework, backing companies he believed in, and growing rich on their success-a story that will show you that opportunity abounds for anyone willing to go for it."

But their investment strategies are so widely divergent, what could they possibly have in common?<br /><br />As Mark Tier demonstrates in this insightful book, the secrets that made Buffet, Icahn, and Soros the world's three richest investors are the same mental habits and strategies they all practice religiously. However, these are mental habits and strategies that fly in the face of Wall Street's conventional mindset. For example:<br /><br />-Buffett, Icahn, and Soros do not diversify. When they buy, they buy as much as they can.<br /><br />-They're not focused on the profits they expect to make. Going in, they're not investing for the money at all.<br /><br />-They don't believe that big profits involve big risks. In fact, they're far more focused on not losing money than making it.<br /><br />-Wall Street research reports? They never read them. They're not interested in what other people think. Indeed, Buffett says he only reads analyst reports when he needs a laugh.<br /><br />In <i>The Winning Investment Habits of Warren Buffett &amp; George Soros</i> you can discover how the mental habits that guided your last investment decision stack up against those of Buffett, Icahn, and Soros.

Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist,,Roger Lowenstein,eng,5353,,,,,,,"Starting from scratch, simply by picking stocks and companies for investment, Warren Buffett amassed one of the epochal fortunes of the twentieth century—an astounding net worth of $10 billion, and counting. His awesome investment record has made him a cult figure popularly known for his seeming contradictions: a billionaire who has a modest lifestyle, a phenomenally successful investor who eschews the revolving-door trading of modern Wall Street, a brilliant dealmaker who cultivates a homespun aura.<br /><br />Journalist Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett’s family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive, inside account of the life and career of this American original. Buffett explains Buffett’s investment strategy—a long-term philosophy grounded in buying stock in companies that are undervalued on the market and hanging on until their worth invariably surfaces—and shows how it is a reflection of his inner self."

It's a glimpse of a side of the business the financial periodicals don't talk about -- 20-hour work days, trips across the country where associates do nothing except carry the pitch book, strip clubs at night, inflated salaries, and high-powered, unforgettable personalities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Monkey Business </i>provides readers with a first-class education in the real life of an investment banker.

From the gorgeous beaches of Rio to the glitzy casinos of Macau to the gritty back streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, Rain becomes a reluctant player in an international game far deadlier and more insidious than any he has encountered before.<br /><br />""In his superb thriller series featuring charismatic Japanese-American assassin John Rain, author Barry Eisler serves up steamy foreign locales, stunning action and enough high-tech weaponry to make for an A-plus boys-and-their-toys read.""<br />--New York Daily News<br /><br />Includes a note from the author introducing the new edition."
Life of Pi,,Yann Martel,en-US,1392700,,Mariner Books / Harvest Books,401,,,,"When sixteen-year-old Pi Patel finds himself stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with only a menacing 450-pound Bengal tiger for company, he quickly realizes that the only way to survive is to make sure the tiger is more afraid of him than he is of it. Finding strength within himself, he draws upon all of his knowledge and cunning, battling for food and shelter, overcoming storms and disasters, and, in the end, making a peace of sorts with both tiger and ocean.<br /><br />"
Vida de Pi,,Yann Martel,spa,1392700,,Ediciones Destino,323,,,,"Pi Patel es un joven que vive en Pondicherry, India, donde su padre es el propietario y encargado del zoológico de la ciudad. A los dieciséis años su familia decide emigrar a Canadá y procurarse una vida mejor con la venta de los animales. Tras complejos trámites, los Patel inician una travesía que se verá truncada por la tragedia: una terrible tormenta hace naufragar el barco donde viajaban. En el inmenso océano Pacífico, una solitaria barcaza de salvamento continúa flotando a la deriva con cinco tripulantes: Pi, una hiena, un orangután, una cebra herida y un enorme macho de tigre de Bengala.<br />Con inteligencia, atrevimiento y, obviamente, miedo, Pi tendrá que echar mano del ingenio para mantenerse a salvo mientras los animales tratan de ocupar puesto en la cadena alimentaria y, a la postre, tendrá que defender su liderazgo frente al único que, previsiblemente, quedará vivo. Aprovechando su conocimiento casi enciclopédico de la fauna que habitaba el zoológico, el joven intentará domar a la fiera, demostrar quién es el macho dominante y sobrevivir con este extraño compañero de viaje.<br />Yann Martel, con talento, humor e imaginación, consigue en esta novela un ejercicio narrativo digno de Kipling o de William Golding. <i>Vida de Pi</i> deleita y sorprende al lector a cada página que, cautivado por una de las historias más prodigiosas de los últimos tiempos, se verá atrapado hasta el asombroso e inesperado final."

Life of Pi,,Yann Martel,eng,1392700,,Penguin,319,,,,"<b>Life of Pi</b> is a masterful and utterly original novel that is at once the story of a young castaway who faces immeasurable hardships on the high seas, and a meditation on religion, faith, art and life that is as witty as it is profound. Using the threads of all of our best stories, Yann Martel has woven a glorious spiritual adventure that makes us question what it means to be alive, and to believe.<br /><br />Growing up in Pondicherry, India, Piscine Molitor Patel -- known as Pi -- has a rich life. Bookish by nature, young Pi acquires a broad knowledge of not only the great religious texts but of all literature, and has a great curiosity about how the world works. His family runs the local zoo, and he spends many of his days among goats, hippos, swans, and bears, developing his own theories about the nature of animals and how human nature conforms to it. Pi’s family life is quite happy, even though his brother picks on him and his parents aren’t quite sure how to accept his decision to simultaneously embrace and practise three religions -- Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.<br /><br />But despite the lush and nurturing variety of Pi’s world, there are broad political changes afoot in India, and when Pi is sixteen his parents decide that the family needs to escape to a better life. Choosing to move to Canada, they close the zoo, pack their belongings, and board a Japanese cargo ship called the Tsimtsum. Travelling with them are many of their animals, bound for zoos in North America. However, they have only just begun their journey when the ship sinks, taking the dreams of the Patel family down with it. Only Pi survives, cast adrift in a lifeboat with the unlikeliest of travelling companions: a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena, and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br /><br />Thus begins Pi Patel’s epic, 227-day voyage across the Pacific, and the powerful story of faith and survival at the heart of Life of Pi. Worn and scared, oscillating between hope and despair, Pi is witness to the playing out of the food chain, quite aware of his new position within it. When only the tiger is left of the seafaring menagerie, Pi realizes that his survival depends on his ability to assert his own will, and sets upon a grand and ordered scheme to keep from being Richard Parker’s next meal.<br /><br />As the days pass, Pi fights both boredom and terror by throwing himself into the practical details of surviving on the open sea -- catching fish, collecting rain water, protecting himself from the sun -- all the while ensuring that the tiger is also kept alive, and knows that Pi is the key to his survival. The castaways face gruelling pain in their brushes with starvation, illness, and the storms that lash the small boat, but there is also the solace of beauty: the rainbow hues of a dorado’s death-throes, the peaceful eye of a looming whale, the shimmering blues of the ocean’s swells. Hope is fleeting, however, and despite adapting his religious practices to his daily routine, Pi feels the constant, pressing weight of despair. It is during the most hopeless and gruelling days of his voyage that Pi whittles to the core of his beliefs, casts off his own assumptions, and faces his underlying terrors head-on.<br /><br />As Yann Martel has said in one interview, “The theme of this novel can be summarized in three lines. Life is a story. You can choose your story. And a story with an imaginative overlay is the better story.” And for Martel, the greatest imaginative overlay is religion. “God is a shorthand for anything that is beyond the material -- any greater pattern of meaning.” In Life of Pi, the question of stories, and of what stories to believe, is front and centre from the beginning, when the author tells us how he was led to Pi Patel and to this novel: in an Indian coffee house, a gentleman told him, “I have a story that will make you believe in God.” And as this novel comes to its brilliant conclusion, Pi shows us that the story with the imaginative overlay is also the story that contains the most truth.<br /><br /><br />From the Trade Paperback edition."

It is also the introduction of a bold and talented literary voice. <br />Before considering reading this book, please see the BookBrowse note on the book jacket/review page.<br /><br />BookBrowse Note: January 9th 2006: An article in the Smoking Gun claimed that James Frey (author of A Million Little Pieces and My Friend Leonard) fabricated key parts of his books. They cited police records, court documents and interviews with law enforcement agents which belie a number of Frey's claims regarding criminal charges against him, jail terms and his fugitive status.<br /><br />In an interview with the Smoking Gun, Frey admitted that he had 'embellished central details' in A Million Little Pieces and backtracked on claims he made in the book.<br /><br />January 26th 2006. Frey's publisher stated that while it initially stood by him, after further questioning of the author, the house has ""sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished.""

This book may share an alphabetical lineage with the Frey book, but there is no melodramatic redemption here -- it is not a parody of that book but its own entity. As one of the characters from the book says, We're still involved in the commission of the acts that will require redemption -- and those stories are always so much more fun. Bonkers and his bizarre team embarks on a gonzo tear through the streets of Los Angeles and across the pop cultural landscape as well. In his satirical quest for truth in journalism, and life, he must navigate through the many odd tiers of social class, in both the Southern California culture and in his Machiavellian office life and its absurd red and blue political divisions. This is no heart-wrenching tale of excess, its destination is hilarity, so it presses the pedal to the metal and takes no prisoners."

Along the way, the artful leader must: <br /><br />• Stimulate effectiveness by enabling others to reach both their personal potential and their institutional potential <br /><br />• Take a role in developing, expressing, and defending civility and values<br /><br />• Nurture new leaders and ensure the continuation of the corporate culture<br /><br />LEADERSHIP IS AN ART offers a proven design for achieving success by developing the generous spirit within all of us.

He left a legacy of compositions, and many of his works are heard regularly in recitals and concerts today. His student pieces are considered indispensable by generations of guitarists. The studies and exercises contained in the six opus numbers here provide some of the most effective material in the entire guitar literature for building and refining a superior technical command of the guitar.

In that uncertain time, it was a comfort to know that he was on the scene and in control, making the best of a dire situation.<br /><br />But was he really?<br /><br /><em>Grand Illusion</em> is the definitive report on Rudy Giuliani's role in 9/11—the true story of what happened that day and the first clear-eyed evaluation of Giuliani's role before, during, and after the disaster.<br /><br />While the pictures of a soot-covered Giuliani making his way through the streets became very much a part of his personal mythology, they were also a symbol of one of his greatest failures. The mayor's performance, though marked by personal courage and grace under fire, followed two terms in office pursuing an utterly wrongheaded approach to the city's security against terrorism. Turning the mythology on its head, <em>Grand Illusion</em> reveals how Giuliani has revised his own history, casting himself as prescient terror hawk when in fact he ran his administration as if terrorist threats simply did not exist, too distracted by pet projects and turf wars to attend to vital precautions.<br /><br />Authors Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins also provide the first authoritative view of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, recounting the triumphs and missteps of the city's efforts to heal itself. With surprising new reporting about the victims, the villains, and the heroes, this is an eye-opening reassessment of one of the pivotal events—and politicians—of our time."

New York City's Mayor. America's Number One Cop. A municipal superhero who needs no phone booth. A politician of astonishing complexity whose full story has never been told. Until now. Guiliani has assumed mythic proportions, the can-do emblem of the new urban politics. He has been heralded as the ultimate turn-around artist - projecting himself as the reformer who single-handedly salvaged a crime-ridden and blighted New York. From his days in the Eighties as the Michael Milken-busting U.S. Attorney of Manhattan to his current purge of hundreds of thousands from his city's welfare rolls, Giuliani has targeted rich and poor with the same relentless certitude. This investigative biography starts with the college kid who confided his presidential dream to his girlfriend and practiced future campaign speeches in front of her at home. It analyzes his substantial impact as U.S. Attorney, badly wounding the Mafia, ransacking the white collared halls of Wall Street and forever changing the face of New York politics. It looks at his celebrated crime reduction and other achievements through a new lens, highlighting the single-mindedness that has made Giuliani one of America's most important and controversial figures. With two marriages as troubled and secretive as his family history, Giuliani is on every New Yorker's therapeutic couch, stirring feelings as intense as the ones that visibly boil inside of him. Though he has become a national legend, his re-election total in 1997 was the lowest in seventy-four years. Wayne Barrett, co-author of the bestselling <i>City for Sale</i> , draws on twenty years of reporting on Giuliani to bring us the most comprehensive and newsbreaking biography of a man of giant contradictions and unpredictable expectations."

The author of nine bestsellers--including the history-making <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</em>--John Gray expands on the expert advice touched upon in his previous books and distills each message into a powerful, inspiring daily meditation in this newest volume. There's no doubt about it: The relationship between men and women is extremely complex. We often forget just how different the sexes are, and become frustrated and confused by a loved one's behavior. Every day we need to be reminded of these differences and realize that it's okay to be different as long as we recognize and understand the behavior of the opposite sex. In <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days,</em> John Gray provides us with daily inspirations that lovingly and insightfully remind us of the contrasts between Mars and Venus, allowing us to solve conflicts in our relationships.<br /><br />Each month is devoted to a single theme, with the daily meditations enlarging on the particular subject at hand. The topics correlate with the very traits of the month itself: January, an exhilarating time of new beginnings, inspires resolve and the desire to excel. In February, when we find ourselves deep in winter's grip and challenged by constant emotional upheaval, we seek reminders of the importance of commitment and the need for patience. May concentrates on such springtime issues as harmony and appreciation.

When she feels loved, her self-esteem rises and falls like a wave in motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom, her mood will shift suddenly, and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically, her wave begins to rise back up...By recognizing this pattern, a man doesn't take it personally. When he doesn't feel as if he is being blamed for her downs, he can be more supportive.<br /><br />A rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle, which involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again...Most women are surprised to realize that even when a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer.

Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,,Michael   Lewis,eng,416305,,W. W. Norton  Company,317,,,,"Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis's <i>Moneyball</i>, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans. <p> Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, <i>Moneyball</i> is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (<i>Liar's Poker</i>, <i>The New New Thing</i>), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes <i>Moneyball</i> an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. <i>--John Moe</i></p>"

Pressfield has created a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters, from the unforgettable Selene, whose surrender to the Greeks does nothing to tame her; to her lover, Damon, an Athenian warrior who grows to cherish the wild Amazon ways; to the narrator, Bones, a young girl from a noble family who was nursed by Selene from birth and secretly taught the Amazon way; to the great Theseus, the tragic king; and to Antiope, the noble queen who betrayed tal Kyrte for the love of Theseus.<br /><br />With astounding immediacy and extraordinary attention to military detail, Pressfield transports readers into the heat and terror of war. Equally impressive is his creation of the Amazon nation, its people, its rituals and myths, its greatness and savagery. Last of the Amazons is thrilling on every page, an epic tale of the clash between wildness and civilization, patriotism and love, man and woman."

Comienza entonces el relato de su infancia en Macedonia, cuando ya acompañaba a su padre a ver el entrenamiento de sus ejércitos, educado por Aristóteles, cuando más tarde ya se convertiría él mismo en soldado, luchando bajo el mando de su padre que logró devolver el honor a la tierra de Macedonia, convirtiéndose en un guerrero temido y respetado, llamado a superar las hazañas de su padre. <br />Siendo todavía muy joven, su padre es asesinado y él se hace cargo del mandato del reino, demostrando su capacidad de liderazgo y militar, sometiendo a ejércitos más poderosos que el suyo, enfrentándose a reyes y emperadores y extendiendo su conquista a las tierras de Oriente Medio, sometiendo uno a uno a los pueblos de Palestina, Egipto, y pronto empezaría a ser considerado un Dios. En Mesopotamia se enfrenta al primer problema enfrentándose a un ejército superior al suyo, un millón de hombres, pero aún así cayó Babilonia. Alejandro se instaló allí y su ejército empezó a ablandarse, los soldados a convertirse en cortesanos, hasta que comprendió que debía seguir avanzando, hacer lo que mejor sabía: conquistar. A continuación cayó Persépolis, luego en Afganistán tuvo que enfrentar un nuevo enemigo y una manera distinta de hacer la guerra, y tras tres años de campaña terminó comprando la fidelidad de las tribus afganas. Avanzando siempre hacia el Este, hasta la India, y allí sus hombres comprendieron que ya no podían dar más de sí, que el fin del mundo por el Este quedaba muy lejos y le pidieron que detuviera su conquista y regresar a casa. Alejandro se opuso en un principio pero al final comprendió que llevaban razón y ordenó el regreso. Habían pasado ocho años desde que salieran de Macedonia. Durante el regreso Alejandro cae enfermo y muere rodeado de sus hombres. <br />Una entretenida epopeya bélica, con un protagonista que toma el cariz de héroe y casi Dios, y que rinde un retrato completo del guerrero ávido de gloria y del hombre."

After first considering the virtues of romantic love, their conversation develops into a wide-ranging discussion on such subjects as the pursuit of beauty, the nature of humanity, the immortality of the soul and the attainment of truth, and ends with an in-depth consideration of the principles of rhetoric. Probably a work of Plato’s maturity, the <i>Phaedrus</i> represents a high point in his achievement as a writer.

In this volume, distinguished classicist Seth Benardete interprets and pairs two important Platonic dialogues, the <i>Gorgias</i> and the <i>Phaedrus</i>, illuminating Socrates’ notion of rhetoric and Plato’s conception of morality and eros in the human soul.<br /><br />            Following his discussion of the <i>Gorgias</i> as a dialogue about the rhetoric of morality, Benardete turns to the <i>Phaedrus</i> as a discourse about genuine rhetoric, namely the science of eros, or true philosophy. This novel interpretation addresses numerous issues in Plato studies: the relation between the structure of the <i>Gorgias </i>and the image of soul/city in the <i>Republic</i>, the relation between the structure of <i>Phaedrus</i> and the concept of eros, and Socrates’ notion of ignorance, among others."

How should we understand such concepts as: the beloved, physical beauty, the beauty that transcends the physical, and the power of love between men as the ancient Greeks understood it? In these three dialogues, the Lysis, Phaedrus, and Symposium, Socrates, the gadfly of Athens, searches for the truth about love and friendship. In doing so, he reveals how his Athenian contemporaries regarded homosexual love as an educative, aesthetic, and social force."

Leaving the more recondite scholarly preoccupations aside, he concentrates on the content, bringing the actual situation in the dialogue -- Athens and its intellectuals engaged in spirited debate -- alive. Equally alive is the discussion of ideas, which are brought to bear on contemporary experience and made to prove the perennial validity of Socratic wisdom, and its power to excite the mind.

Nichols, Jr., offers precise yet unusually readable translations of two great Platonic dialogues on rhetoric. </p><p>The Gorgias presents an intransigent argument that justice is superior to injusticeto the extent that suffering an injustice is preferable to committing an unjust act. The dialogue contains some of Plato's most significant and famous discussions of major political themes, and focuses dramatically and with unrivaled intensity on Socrates as a political thinker and actor. Featuring some of Plato's most soaringly lyrical passages, the Phaedrus investigates the soul's erotic longing and its relationship to the whole cosmos, as well as inquiring into the nature of rhetoric and the problem of writing.</p><p>Nichols's attention to dramatic detail brings the dialogues to life. Plato's striking variety in conversational address (names and various terms of relative warmth and coolness) is carefully reproduced, as is alteration in tone and implication even in the short responses. The translations render references to the gods accurately and non-monotheistically for the first time, and include a fascinating variety of oaths and invocations. A general introduction on rhetoric from the Greeks to the present shows the problematic relation of rhetoric to philosophy and politics, states the themes that unite the two dialogues, and outlines interpretive suggestions that are then developed more fully for each dialogue. </p><p>The twin dialogues reveal both the private and the political rhetoric emphatic in Plato's philosophy, yet often ignored in commentaries on it. Nichols believes that Plato's thought on rhetoric has been largely misunderstood, and he uses his translations as an opportunity to reconstruct the classical position on right relations between thought and public activity.</p>"

Gorgias: Sophist and Artist,,Scott Consigny,,5533,,University of South Carolina Press,242,,,,"Of the ancient Greek Sophists, Gorgias of Leontini (ca. 483-ca. 376 b.c.e.) has endured more than his share of insistent detractors. Aristophanes depicted him as a barbaric sycophant, Plato considered him an opportunistic charlatan indifferent to truth and morality, and Aristotle saw him as a gaudy but inept stylist.<br /><br />Scott Consigny joins the commentators who find merit in Gorgias's thought, but his perceptions of Gorgias differ from those of the two most influential efforts at rehabilitation. He maintains that both the subjectivist reading by Hegel and the empiricist reading by George Grote--and among the rhetoricians of today by Richard Enos and Edward Schiappa--grant too much to Plato and Aristotle at the same time that, like most current interpretations of Gorgias, they fail to take into account all the extant remarks by the Sophist. By viewing Gorgias as in more radical disagreement with Plato and Aristotle than the other rehabilitators do, Consigny brings order to the Sophist's elusive, enigmatic ideas and peculiar style and stations him as a seminal philosopher and skilled artist, a formidable rival to Plato and Parmenides.<br /><br />On Consigny's reading, Gorgias is an antifoundationalist who repudiates the idea that knowledge and truth must be grounded in objective standards or in subjective certainty but instead views truth as a category that a community employs to endorse what it finds persuasive. Consigny's reading is one development of Stanley Fish's assertion that modern antifoundationalism is old Sophism writ analytic, and he pursues his insight into Gorgias's moral and political philosophy, where he sees antifoundationalism manifesting itself in a conventionalist ethic and the advocacy of a peaceful competition among different societies. In Gorgias's notorious style Consigny detects a playful mocking of the genres in which his contemporaries worked but the serious underscoring of the rhetoricity of all texts."
Gorgias and the New Sophistic Rhetoric,,Bruce McComiskey,,5534,,Southern Illinois University Press,176,,,,"In <i>Gorgias and the New Sophistic Rhetoric</i>, Bruce McComiskey achieves three rhetorical goals: he treats a single sophist's rhetorical <i>technê</i> (art) in the context of the intellectual upheavals of fifth-century bce Greece, thus avoiding the problem of generalizing about a disparate group of individuals; he argues that we must abandon Platonic assumptions regarding the sophists in general and Gorgias in particular, opting instead for a holistic reading of the Gorgianic fragments; and he reexamines the practice of appropriating sophistic doctrines, particularly those of Gorgias, in light of the new interpretation of Gorgianic rhetoric offered in this book.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In the first two chapters, McComiskey deals with a misconception based on selective and Platonic readings of the extant fragments: that Gorgias's rhetorical <i>technê</i> involves the deceptive practice of manipulating public opinion. This popular and ultimately misleading interpretation of Gorgianic doctrines has been the basis for many neosophistic appropriations. The final three chapters deal with the nature and scope of neosophistic rhetoric in light of the non-Platonic and holistic interpretation of Gorgianic rhetoric McComiskey postulates in his opening chapters. He concludes by examining the future of communication studies to discover what roles neosophistic doctrines might play in the twenty-first century.<br /><br /> <br /><br />McComiskey also provides a selective bibliography of scholarship on sophistic rhetoric and philosophy in English since 1900."

The book, here ably translated by University of Chicago scholar David Grene, earned Herodotus the epithet ""The Father of History"" in ancient times. He distinguishes between the things seen with his own eyes &amp; those of which he had only heard. But he was often too credulous of things told to him by his peers along the way, for which reason his younger contemporary Thucydides called him ""The Father of Lies."" Renowned in his own time for his humanity &amp; wide-ranging curiosity, Herodotus shows an insatiable appetite for both useful information &amp; a good yarn. <i>The History</i> is a starting point for any student of the past."

Slow in speech, shy in manner, thoughtful in mind, weak in health, he went back north for a quiet life. Influenced by the group of poets there, he may have written some of the doubtful poems included in our Virgilian manuscripts. All his undoubted extant work is written in his perfect hexameters. Earliest comes the collection of ten pleasingly artificial bucolic poems, the ""Eclogues,"" which imitated freely Theocritus's idylls. They deal with pastoral life and love. Before 29 BCE came one of the best of all didactic works, the four hooks of Georgics on tillage, trees, cattle, and bees. Virgil's remaining years were spent in composing his great, not wholly finished, epic the ""Aeneid,"" on the traditional theme of Rome's origins through Aeneas of Troy. Inspired by the Emperor Augustus's rule, the poem is Homeric in metre and method but influenced also by later Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and learning, and deeply Roman in spirit. Virgil died in 19 BCE at Brundisium on his way home from Greece, where he had intended to round off the ""Aeneid."" He had left in Rome a request that all its twelve books should be destroyed if he were to die then, but they were published by the executors of his will.<br /><br />The Loeb Classical Library edition of Virgil is in two volumes."
City Eclogue,,Ed Roberson,eng,5558,,Atelos Press,136,,,,"Poetry. African American Studies. Ed Roberson might no longer live in Pittsburgh, but the city in which he was born and raised still leaves its fragmented structures etched throughout his poetry. A city of hard work and hard times, the now-impoverished neighborhoods that had at one time stood as centers of jazz and art; the hills, the rivers, the skyscraping iron and steel, and the pain. Though most of the poems in this collection do not necessarily take place in Pittsburgh, there is a rhythmic fragmentation here painting portraits of urban life in general. Beauty, music, poverty, blood, and concrete seem to live within the line breaks, while breath-stopping pauses halt you just long enough so that--like at a smoky backroom jazz club--you can't wait to see what he does next."

Virgil drew upon the tradition of Greek pastoral poetry, importing it into an Italian setting and providing in these two works the model for subsequent European interpretations of the genre.<br />The <i>Eclogues</i> unfolds in an idyllic landscape, under less-than-tranquil circumstances. Its shepherds tend their flocks amid not only the inner turmoil of unrequited love but also the external pressures of the civil war that followed Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 B.C. Forced from their homes, the dispossessed shepherds voice a heartfelt longing for peace.<br />Dryden declared the <i>Georgics</i> ""the best poem by the best poet,"" and through the ages, it has been much admired and imitated. A paean to Italy and the country's natural beauty, it rejoices in the values of rustic piety, the pleasures of family life, and the vitality of the Italian people."

""I wanted to get at H. before the violence sets in,"" West remarked: ""But most of all I wanted to get the motion of his mind, as seen by another."" Hitler spews his rage over his blighted career and his desperate wooing of Treischnitt and Kolberhoff, ""proud famous painters both.""

But what came before the Greeks? What if we could prove that all myths have one common origin in a celestial cosmology? What if the gods, the places they lived &amp; what they did are but ciphers for celestial activity, a language for the perpetuation of complex astronomical data? Drawing on scientific data, historical &amp; literary sources, the authors argue that our myths are the remains of a preliterate astronomy, an exacting science whose power &amp; accuracy were suppressed &amp; then forgotten by an emergent Greco-Roman world view. This fascinating book throws into doubt the self-congratulatory assumptions of Western science about the unfolding development &amp; transmission of knowledge. This is a truly seminal &amp; original thesis, a book that should be read by anyone interested in science, myth &amp; the interactions between the two."

John Ruskin referred to the Peloponnesian War as ""the suicide of Greece"". It is an apt phrase. For never in history has a community reached such sublime heights of civilized life only to plummet to ignominious defeat within a single lifetime. In one of the great coincidences of history, Thucydides was enabled to observe this event, and commit to paper the most accurate, dramatic, and beautifully expressive history that has yet been written...of his era, or any other.<br />Volume 2 opens with the Spartans and Athenians pursuing their grim struggle. As the war continues to drain both sides materially and emotionally, a truce is finally arranged after the deaths of thousands, including the great Brasidas and Pericles. But the Athenians are persuaded by a young Alcibiades to launch an expedition against Syracuse in Sicily. In what has been hailed as the finest description of an historical event ever recorded, Thucydides provides posterity with a lucid and horrifying chronicle of the incredible folly and incompetence of the ill-fated Sicilian Expedition. When the magnificent Spartan general, Gylippus, slips into the besieged city of Syracuse, his mere presence tips the scales. Listen as the tragedy unfolds and Athens, reeling from the catastrophe, valiantly rebuilds her forces and continues the relentless struggle. In the face of odds that appear increasingly hopeless, Athens somehow finds the resolve to maintain the conflict.<br />This audiobook uses Benjamin Jowett's translation."
Thucydides: An Introduction for the Common Reader,,Perez Zagorin,,5592,,Princeton University Press,190,,,,"This book is a concise, readable introduction to the Greek author Thucydides, who is widely regarded as one of the foremost historians of all time.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why does Thucydides continue to matter today? Perez Zagorin answers this question by examining Thucydides' landmark <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i>, one of the great classics of Western civilization. This history, Zagorin explains, is far more than a mere chronicle of the conflict between Athens and Sparta, the two superpowers of Greece in the fifth century BCE. It is also a remarkable story of politics, decision-making, the uses of power, and the human and communal experience of war. Zagorin maintains that the work remains of permanent interest because of the exceptional intellect that Thucydides brought to the writing of history, and to the originality, penetration, and the breadth and intensity of vision that inform his narrative.<br /><br />The first half of Zagorin's book discusses the intellectual and historical background to Thucydides' work and its method, structure, and view of the causes of the war. The following chapters deal with Thucydides' portrayal of the Athenian leader Pericles and his account of some of the main episodes of the war, such as the revolution in Corcyra and the Athenian invasion of Sicily. The book concludes with an insightful discussion of Thucydides as a thinker and philosophic historian.<br /><br />Designed to introduce both students and general readers to a work that is an essential part of a liberal education, this book seeks to encourage readers to explore Thucydides--one of the world's greatest historians--for themselves."

In each journal, Handke concentrates on small things he observes, trying to capture their essence, their “simple, unadorned validity.” What results is a work of remarkable precision, in which he uncovers the general appearance of random objects––an ash tree, a shoeshine man, hats in a crowd, a boat loading on a pier––and discovers their inner workings and mystery. Always, his writing hints at the unknown. Describing the snow melting in a garden or falling during a train ride through inland Japan, the glowworms illuminating the plains in Friuli, the tidal waters flowing and receding off the Atlantic coast of Spain, these amazing little “epics” reveal a narrator obsessed with the wonders of detail and marveling, as are we, at the scope and variety of the natural world."
Thucydides Book I: A Students' Grammatical Commentary,,Howard Don Cameron,,1288132,,University of Michigan Press,148,,,,"The first book of Thucydides is a compact masterpiece. Here he sets up the conditions that led to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C. With great economy, he analyzes the origins of large-scale wars; integrates a sketch of the historical background into the larger thematic threads of his narrative; presents a brief statement of his methods and goals; outlines a hierarchy of causation; develops a theory of character and human nature; and presents a theory of leadership, chance, and foresight, all within a narrative structure that perfectly focuses these elements.<br />Because Book I is not primarily historical narrative, it inevitably proves difficult for inexperienced readers. Despite the convolutions and density of Thucydides' prose style, no authoritative commentary has been published since the early days of the last century. H. D. Cameron is a renowned expert in Greek and comparative grammar and has written this handbook for all levels of classical students and scholars. His commentary authoritatively accounts for the last one hundred years of evolving grammatical and linguistic theory as they apply to the seminal work of Thucydides.<br />H. D. Cameron is Professor of Greek and Latin and Director of the Great Books Program at the University of Michigan.<br />"
Apologies to Thucydides: Understanding History as Culture and Vice Versa,,Marshall Sahlins,,5601,,University of Chicago Press,320,,,,"Thucydides' classic work on the history of the Peloponnesian War is the root of Western conceptions of history—including the idea that Western history is the foundation of everyone else's. Here, Marshall Sahlins takes on Thucydides and the conceptions of history he wrought with a groundbreaking new book that shows what a difference an anthropological concept of culture can make to the writing of history.<br /><br />Sahlins begins by confronting Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War with an analogous ""Polynesian War,"" the fight for the domination of the Fiji Islands (1843-55) between a great sea power (like Athens) and a great land power (like Sparta). Sahlins draws parallels between the conflicts with an eye to their respective systems of power and sovereignty as well as to Thucydides' alternation between individual (Pericles, Themistocles) and collective (the Athenians, the Spartans) actors in the making of history. Characteristic of most histories ever written, this alternation between the agency of ""Great Men"" and collective entities leads Sahlins to a series of incisive analyses ranging in subject matter from Bobby Thomson's ""shot heard round the world"" for the 1951 Giants to the history-making of Napoleon and certain divine kings to the brouhaha over Elián Gonzalez. Finally, again departing from Thucydides, Sahlins considers the relationship between cultural order and historical contingency through the recounting of a certain royal assassination that changed the course of Fijian history, a story of fratricide and war worthy of Shakespeare.<br /><br />In this most convincing presentation yet of his influential theory of culture, Sahlins experiments with techniques for mixing rich narrative with cultural explication in the hope of doing justice at once to the actions of persons and the customs of people. And he demonstrates the necessity of taking culture into account in the creation of history—with apologies to Thucydides, who too often did not."

In his questioning attitude to traditional pieties, disconcerting shifts of sympathy, disturbingly eloquent evil characters &amp; acute insight into destructive passion, he's also the most strikingly modern of ancient authors. Written in the period of 426-415, during the fierce struggle for supremacy between Athens &amp; Sparta, these five plays are haunted by the horrors of war &amp; its particular impact on women. Only the <b>Suppliants</b>, with its extended debate on democracy &amp; monarchy, can be seen as a patriotic piece. <b>The Trojan Women</b> is perhaps the greatest of all anti-war dramas; <b>Andromache</b> shows the ferocious clash between the wife &amp; concubine of Achilles’ son Neoptolemos; while <b>Hecabe</b> reveals how hatred can drive a victim to an appalling act of cruelty. <b>Electra</b> develops &amp; parodies Aeschylus’ treatment of the same story, in which the heroine &amp; her brother Orestes commit matricide to avenge their father Agamemnon.

The first playwright to depict suffering without reference to the gods, Euripides made his characters speak in human terms and face the consequences of their actions. In Medea, a woman rejected by her lover takes hideous revenge by murdering the children they both love, and Hecabe depicts the former queen of Troy, driven mad by the prospect of her daughter’s sacrifice to Achilles.

Of these, eighteen (plus a play of unknown authorship mistakenly included with his works) have come down to us from antiquity. In this first volume of a new Loeb edition of Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text of three plays and an accurate and graceful translation with explanatory notes.<br /><br /><em>Alcestis</em> is the story of a woman who agrees, in order to save her husband's life, to die in his place. <em>Medea</em> is a tragedy of revenge in which Medea kills her own children, as well as their father's new wife, to punish him for his desertion. The volume begins with <em>Cyclops</em>, a satyr play—the only complete example of this genre to survive. Each play is preceded by an introduction.<br /><br />In a general introduction Kovacs demonstrates that the biographical tradition about Euripides—parts of which view him as a subverter of morality, religion, and art—cannot be relied on. He argues that this tradition has often furnished the unacknowledged starting point for interpretation, and that the way is now clear for an unprejudiced consideration of the plays themselves."

He expects to be embraced in Thebes, but the Theban king, Pentheus, forbids his people to worship him and tries to have him arrested. Enraged, Bacchus drives Pentheus mad and leads him to the mountains, where Pentheus' own mother, Agave, and the women of Thebes tear him to pieces in a Bacchic frenzy. <br />Gibbons, a prize-winning poet, and Segal, a renowned classicist, offer a skilled new translation of this central text of Greek tragedy.<br />"

In this play, Phaedra fights nobly but unsuccessfully against her desire for her stepson Hippolytus, while the young man risks his life to keep her passion secret.

Through them Euripides critically examines social and moral aspects of contemporary life and even specific political events. He endows his figures with shrewdly observed individual character, implicitly deflating the emblematic simplicity of traditional narratives and making him seem the most modern of the great Greek dramatists.<br /><i>The Trojan Women</i>, one of the most powerful indictments of war and the arrogance of power ever written, is played out before the ruined walls of Troy.<br /><br /> A grim recounting of the murder of the innocent, the desecration of shrines, and the enslavement of the women of the defeated city, it reveals the futility of a war fought for essentially frivolous reasons, in which the traditional heroes are shown to be little better than bloodthirsty thugs. <i>Hippolytus</i> is primarily about the dangers of passion and immoderation, whether in pursuing or in thwarting normal desires — struggles symbolized by the gods, who embody natural forces and behave like irresponsible humans.<br />Required study for any college course in literature and mythology, these two masterpieces are essential reading for anyone interested in the roots of world drama."

The Suppliant Women is a commentary on the politics of empire, as the Athenian king Theseus decides to use force of arms rather than persuasion against Thebes.

William Arrowsmith, eminent classical scholar, translator, and General Editor of this highly praised series, rejects the standard view of the Alcestis as a psychological study of the egotist Admetos and his naive but devoted wife. His translation, instead, presents the play as a drama of human existence-in keeping with the tradition of Greek tragedy-with recognizably human characters who also represent masked embodiments of human conditions. The Alcestis thus becomes a metaphysical tragicomedy in which Admetos, who has heretofore led a life without limitations, learns to ""think mortal thoughts."" He acquires the knowledge of limits-the acceptance of death as well as the duty to live-which, according to Euripides, makes people meaningfully human and capable of both courage and compassion. This new interpretation compellingly argues that, for Euripides, suffering humanizes, that exemption makes a man selfish and childish, and that only the courage to accept both life and death leads to the realization of one's humanity, and, in the case of Alcestis, to heroism."

These effects and controversial questions of the composition and stylistics are discussed in the notes and the accompanying essay."

Before him tragedy had consisted of the chorus and one actor; and by introducing a second actor, expanding the dramatic dialogue thus made possible, and reducing the lyrical parts, he practically created Greek tragedy, as we understand it. Like other writers of his time, he acted in his own plays, and trained the chorus in their dances and songs; and he did much to give impressiveness to the performances by his development of the accessories of scene and costume on the stage. Of the seventy or eighty plays which he is said to have written, only seven survive: ""The Suppliant Maidens,"" on the daughters of Danas; ""The Persians,"" dealing with the defeat of Xerxes at Salamis; ""The Seven against Thebes,"" part of a tetra logy on the legend of Thebes; ""Prometheus Bound,"" part of a trilogy, of which the first part was probably ""Prometheus, the Fire-bringer,"" and the last, ""Prometheus Unbound; "" and the ""Oresteia (The House of Atreus),"" the only example of a complete Greek tragic trilogy which has come down to us, consisting of ""Agamemnon, Choephorae (The Libation-Bearers),"" and the ""Eumenides (The Furies).""<br /><br />The Oresteian trilogy on ""The House of Atreus"" is one of the supreme productions of all literature. It deals with the two great themes of the retribution of crime and the inheritance of evil; and here a parallel may be found between the assertions of the justice of God by Aeschylus and by the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel. The nobility of thought and the majesty of style with which these ideas are set forth give this triple drama its place at the head of the literary masterpieces of the antique world."

In <i>The Birds</i>, two cunning Athenians persuade the birds to build the utopian city of 'Much Cuckoo in the Clouds' in the sky, blockading the Olympian gods and installing themselves as new deities. <i>The Knights</i> is a venomous satire on Cleon, a prominent Athenian demagogue, who vies with a humble sausage-seller for the approval of the people; while <i>The Assembly-Women </i>deals with the battle of the sexes as the women of Athens infiltrate the all-male Assembly in disguise. The lengthy conflict with Sparta is the subject of <i>Peace</i>, inspired by the hope of a settlement in 421 BC, and <i>Wealth </i>reflects on the economic catastrophe that hit Athens after the war.<br /><br />These lively translations by David Barrett and Alan H. Sommerstein capture the full humour of the plays. The introduction examines Aristophanes' life and times, and the comedy and poetry of his works. This volume also includes an introductory note for each play.<br /><br />Aristophanes (c.445-386 BC) was probably born in Athens. Little is known about his life, but there is a portrait of him in Plato's<i> Symposium</i>. He was twice threatened with prosecution in the 420s for his outspoken attacks on the prominent politician Cleon, but in 405 he was publicly honoured and crowned for promoting Athenian civic unity in <i>The Frogs</i>. Aristophanes had his first comedy produced when he was about twenty-one, and wrote forty plays in all. The eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes are published in the Penguin Classics series as <i>The Birds and Other Plays</i>, <i>Lysistrata and Other Plays</i>, <i>The Wasps and Other Plays </i>and <i>The Frogs and Other Plays</i>.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>The Birds and Other Plays,</i> you might like Aristophanes' <i>The Frogs and Other Plays</i>, also available in Penguin Classics."

Looking at eleven plays, Strauss shows that this confrontation is essentially one between poetry and philosophy, and that poetry emerges as an autonomous wisdom capable of rivaling philosophy.<br /><br />""Strauss gives us an impressive addition to his life's work—the recovery of the Great Tradition in political philosophy. The problem the book proposes centers formally upon Socrates. As is typical of Strauss, he raises profound issues with great courage. . . . [He addresses] a problem that has been inherent in Western life ever since [Socrates'] execution: the tension between reason and religion. . . . Thus, we come to Aristophanes, the great comic poet, and his attack on Socrates in the play <i>The Clouds.</i> . . [Strauss] translates it into the basic problem of the relation between poetry and philosophy, and resolves this by an analysis of the function of comedy in the life of the city."" —Stanley Parry, <i>National Review</i><br />"

This is the fourth and final volume in the new Loeb Classical Library edition of his plays.<br /><br /><i>Frogs</i> was produced in 405 BCE, shortly after the deaths of Sophocles and Euripides. Dionysus, the patron god of theater, journeys to the underworld to retrieve Euripides. There he is recruited to judge a contest between the traditional Aeschylus and the modern Euripides, a contest that yields both sparkling comedy and insight on ancient literary taste.<br /><br />In <i>Assemblywomen</i>, Athenian women plot to save Athens from male misgovernance. They transfer power to themselves and institute a new social order in which all inequalities based on wealth, age, and beauty are eliminated--with raucously comical results.<br /><br />The gentle humor and straightforward morality of <i>Wealth</i> made it the most popular of Aristophanes's plays from classical times to the Renaissance. Here the god Wealth is cured of his blindness; his newfound ability to distinguish good people from bad brings playfully portrayed social consequences."

Spectacles of Truth in Classical Greek Philosophy: Theoria in Its Cultural Context,,Andrea Wilson Nightingale,,5730,,Cambridge University Press,311,,,,"From being viewed as an activity performed in practical and political contexts, wisdom in fourth-century BC Athens came to be conceived in terms of theoria, or the wise man as a ""spectator"" of truth.

By incorporating traditional genres of poetry and rhetoric into his dialogues, Plato marks the boundaries of philosophy as a discursive and as a social practice."

Along the Juniata: Thomas Cole and the Dissemination of American Landscape Imagery,,Nancy Siegel,,5740,,University of Washington Press,143,,,,"Along the Juniata focuses on the dissemination of American landscape imagery in the early to mid-19th century. Through a variety of media including drawings, paintings, engravings and decorative arts, images of the American landscape were translated and reproduced in large numbers to provide an eager audience with examples of patriotic views and scenes of natural wonders. This book investigates the art of Thomas Cole as representative of this process and examines the means by which an 1827 drawing by the artist of a scene in the Allegheny Mountains was transformed into a painting, engraved copies, and adorned imported Staffordshire ceramics designed to appeal specifically to an American audience. The widespread use of this popular image by Cole demonstrates the cultural demand for images of the American landscape as it was fuelled by a period of increased nationalism during the first half of the 19th century."
The Origins of Rhetoric in Ancient Greece,,Thomas Cole,,5741,,Johns Hopkins University Press,208,,,,"This book argues that it is not fair to judge early Greek rhetoric by the standards of Plato and Aristotle... it should be seen, rather, as a series of largely unsystematic efforts to explore, more by example rather than by precept, all aspects of discourse. As artistic prose came to be disseminated in written texts and so available in a form that could be analyzed, evaluated and imitated, the forms of the early texts evolve into teatises such as Aristotle's Rhetoric ."

"The Puritan Tradition in Revolutionary, Federalist, and Whig Political Theory: A Rhetoric of Origins",,Dean Hammer,,5744,,"Peter Lang Gmbh, Internationaler Verlag Der Wissenschaften",218,,,,"""The Puritan Tradition"" examines how a Puritan past, historically reconstructed as a founding legend, gave meaning to early American political culture. In tracing the rhetorical invocations of this Puritan legacy, this study lends important insight into how this constructed past helped shape the political thought that underlies revolutionary, Federalist, and Whig political discourse. This emphasis on the changing political uses of this puritan Past is an important departure from scholarship that identifies an enduring Puritan essence that is read forward into American culture. Where such scholarship has often yielded either unpersuasive genealogies or a view of Puritanism as dissolving into irrelevance, ""The Puritan Tradition"" demonstrates how a Puritan past continues to play a critical role in American political identity."
Political Philosophy and Rhetoric: A Study of the Origins of American Party Politics,,John Zvesper,,5746,,Cambridge University Press,237,,,,"This book analyses the origins of modern party politics in America. Dr Zvesper argues that the partisan conflict between Federalists and Republicans in the 1790s was not merely an interesting historical sequel to the American Revolution and the framing of the Constitution, but was a confrontation of two of the fundamental alternatives of modern political philosophy. Consideration of this fact, along with evidence of the class structure of American society, is then used to explain why the Republican party was the natural superior in the dispute with Federalism, and why Republican philosophy and rhetoric have been so essential to American politics ever since."

Protagoras and Logos: A Study in Greek Philosophy and Rhetoric,,Edward Schiappa,,5749,,University of South Carolina Press,251,,,,"<i>Protagoras and Logos</i> brings together in a meaningful synthesis the contributions and rhetoric of the first and most famous of the Older Sophists, Protagoras of Abdera. Most accounts of Protagoras rely on the somewhat hostile reports of Plato and Aristotle. By focusing on Protagoras's own surviving words, this study corrects many long-standing misinterpretations and presents significant facts: Protagoras was a first-rate philosophical thinker who positively influenced the theories of Plato and Aristotle, and Protagoras pioneered the study of language and was the first theorist of rhetoric. In addition to illustrating valuable methods of translating and reading fifth-century B.C.E. Greek passages, the book marshals evidence for the important philological conclusion that the Greek word translated as rhetoric was a coinage by Plato in the early fourth century.<br /><br />In this second edition, Edward Schiappa reassesses the philosophical and pedagogical contributions of Protagoras. Schiappa argues that traditional accounts of Protagoras are hampered by mistaken assumptions about the Sophists and the teaching of the art of rhetoric in the fifth century. He shows that, contrary to tradition, the so-called Older Sophists investigated and taught the skills of logos, which is closer to modern conceptions of critical reasoning than of persuasive oratory. Schiappa also offers interpretations for each of Protagoras's major surviving fragments and examines Protagoras's contributions to the theory and practice of Greek education, politics, and philosophy. In a new afterword Schiappa addresses historiographical issues that have occupied scholars in rhetorical studies over the past ten years, and throughout the study he provides references to scholarship from the last decade that has refined his views on Protagoras and other Sophists."
The Beginnings of Rhetorical Theory in Classical Greece,,Edward Schiappa,,5750,,Yale University Press,240,,,,"In this provocative book, Edward Schiappa argues that rhetorical theory did not originate with the Sophists in the fifth century B.C.E, as is commonly believed, but came into being a century later. Schiappa examines closely the terminology of the Sophists—such as Gorgias and Protagoras—and of their reporters and opponents—especially Plato and Aristotle—and contends that the terms and problems that make up what we think of as rhetorical theory had not yet formed in the era of the early Sophists. His revision of rhetoric’s early history enables him to change the way we read both the Sophists and Aristotle and Plato. Schiappa contends, for example, that Plato probably coined the Greek word for rhetoric; that Gorgias is a “prose rhapsode” whose style does not deserve the criticism it has received; that Isocrates deliberately never uses the Greek work for ""rhetoric"" and that our habit of pitting him versus Plato as “rhetoric versus philosophy” is problematic; and that Aristotle ""disciplined"" the genre of epideictic in a way that robs the genre of its political importance. His book will be of great interest to students of classics, communications, philosophy, and rhetoric.<br /><br />"

In Getting Things Done Allen shows how to:<br /><br />* Apply the ""do it, delegate it, defer it, drop it"" rule to get your in-box to empty<br />* Reassess goals and stay focused in changing situations<br />* Plan projects as well as get them unstuck<br />* Overcome feelings of confusion, anxiety, and being overwhelmed<br />* Feel fine about what you're not doing<br /><br />From core principles to proven tricks, Getting Things Done can transform the way you work, showing you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down."

Formas breves,,Ricardo Piglia,spa,5768,Narrativas hispánicas #292,Anagrama,144,,,,"«Formas breves» es una recopilación de textos misceláneos que el propio autor describe como «páginas perdidas en el diario de un escritor». En ellas reflexiona sobre la literatura, desde la ficción hasta el pensamiento crítico; desde el diálogo con los autores que se han convertido en la estela de su obra e imaginario Arlt, Macedonio, Borges, Gombrowicz, Kafka, Chéjov, Joyce y Hemingway, entre otros hasta los temas más abstractos, como la naturaleza del relato corto o el punto de inflexión entre realidad y ficción. Este es un homenaje a la literatura misma; un lugar donde se pone en juego su doble filo: una ficción que se lee como una verdad apócrifa y un realismo que aparece como un artificio veraz."

Es este un viaje apasionante, una invitación al laboratorio privado de uno de los escritores contemporáneos que lee con mayor lucidez.

The Absent City,"[{'id': '1072', 'name': 'Ricardo Piglia', 'role': ''}, {'id': '84789', 'name': 'Sergio Waisman', 'role': 'Translator'}]",Ricardo Piglia,,5770,,Duke University Press Books,160,,,,"Widely acclaimed throughout Latin America after its 1992 release in Argentina, <i>The Absent City</i> takes the form of a futuristic detective novel. In the end, however, it is a meditation on the nature of totalitarian regimes, on the transition to democracy after the end of such regimes, and on the power of language to create and define reality. Ricardo Piglia combines his trademark avant-garde aesthetics with astute cultural and political insights into Argentina’s history and contemporary condition in this conceptually daring and entertaining work.<br />The novel follows Junior, a reporter for a daily Buenos Aires newspaper, as he attempts to locate a secret machine that contains the mind and the memory of a woman named Elena. While Elena produces stories that reflect on actual events in Argentina, the police are seeking her destruction because of the revelations of atrocities that she—the machine—is disseminating through texts and taped recordings. The book thus portrays the race to recover the history and memory of a city and a country where history has largely been obliterated by political repression. Its narratives—all part of a detective story, all part of something more—multiply as they intersect with each other, like the streets and avenues of Buenos Aires itself. <br />The second of Piglia’s novels to be translated by Duke University Press—the first was <i>Artifical Respiration</i>—this book continues the author’s quest to portray the abuses and atrocities that characterize dictatorships as well as the difficulties associated with making the transition to democracy. Translated and with an introduction by Sergio Waisman, it includes a new afterword by the author."

There's the drama of the botched raid itself, followed by a blowout afterparty, an attempted double-crossing of the corrupt local authorities, and a final shootout where, as a last act of rebellion, the robbers burn all the loot. This gritty tale has been adapted for a major motion picture by renowned Argentine director Marcelo Pinyero."
Respiración artificial,,Ricardo Piglia,spa,5772,Narrativas hispánicas #300,Anagrama,224,,,,"<i>Respiración artificial</i> se trata no sólo del único libro memorable publicado durante el período de la dictadura militar (la edición original es de 1980), sino también de una espléndida ficción que se convierte en espejo de la historia, de una novela que, utilizando la estructura de la novela policíaca -para Piglia éste es uno de los géneros fundamentales de la literatura contemporánea-, puede leerse como una indagación sobre los enigmas de épocas convulsas, de personajes oscuros.<br /><br />El joven escritor Emilio Renzi -que reaparecerá luego en otras obras de Piglia- ha escrito su primer libro, la narración conjentural de una historia que circulaba en su familia en varias versiones. Y es entonces, tras la publicación de aquel relato de equívocas traiciones y castigos, cuando Renzi conoce por fin al protagonista, su tío Marcelo Maggi. A finales de los años setenta, Maggi vive en provincias, en una ciudad fronteriza, dedicado a descifrar las cartas y papeles de Enrique Ossorio, el secretario privado de Juan Manuel de Rosas, un personaje que habría podido ser un héroe, y de quien se sospecha que fue un traidor. De Renzi a Maggi, y de éste a Ossorio: casi sin darnos cuenta hemos retrocedido ciento treinta años y se ha borrado la frontera entre literatura e historia, entre realidad y ficción. Ossorio se suicidó en Chile, en 1850, poco antes de la caída de Rosas, después de un vertiginoso exilio. En sus largas conversaciones, Renzi y Maggi intentan aclarar ese y otros muchos enigmas. Y también encontramos al polaco Tardewski (detrás del cual se esconde, o quizá se muestra, la figura del genial Witold Gombrowicz), quien refiere un encuentro tan posible como inverosímil entre Hitler y Kafka en la Praga de los años veinte; y al paranoico Arocena que, como un lector de novelas policíacas, busca en cada frase la clave que permita descifrar el entero enigma. Y así, a través de exilios y cartas, de libros y de retazos de historia, de vidas desgarradas y relatos inconclusos, se trama una de las novelas más radicalmente originales y atractivas en castellano de las últimas décadas. <br /><br /><i>Respiración artificial</i> es la irrefutable respuesta a quienes se pregunten por qué, tras la muerte de Borges y Bioy Casares, Piglia se convirtiera en la figura que heredó el cetro de la literatura argentina."

This groundbreaking book focuses on the notions of modernity and postmodernity in two countries that never before have been studied comparatively: Argentina and Greece. It examines theories of the postmodern and the problems involved in applying them to the hybrid and sui generis cultural phenomena of the �periphery�. Simultaneously it offers an exciting insight into the work of Jorge Luis Borges, Ricardo Piglia, Dimitris Kalokyris and Achilleas Kyriakidis, whose syncretist aesthetics are symptomatic of the mixing up of different and often opposed aesthetic principles and traditions that occur in �peripheral� locations. This book will be very useful to scholars and students of Latin American, Modern Greek and comparative literature as well as to those interested in Borges studies."

Espero o persigo la emergencia de esos desdoblamientos imprevistos, la aparicion de un sujeto del ensayo diferente, a veces discordante, de la subjetividad del ensayista, porque en ellos se manifiesta, con mas fuerza que en un rasgo de estilo o un gesto de argumentacion idiosincrasico, la voluntad de ensayar una enunciacion del saber en nombre propio. Se podria decir, ironizando, que juego al psicoanalisis de algunas figuraciones intelectuales o literarias, sobre todo porque si no se ha establecido una cierta transferencia con el autor (entendido, en principio, pero no exclusivamente, como aquello en lo que alguien se convirtio por obra de la escritura), estos ejercicios de lectura se vuelven imposibles. Lo que llamo transferencia tiene que ver con la fuerza con la que me impulsan a escribir, aunque no siempre me identifique con ellos, aunque pueda llegar a encarnizarme al criticarlos, los modos en los que algunos ensayistas se exponen cuando buscan articular sus experiencias subjetivas como lectores con los saberes sobre la literatura. Desde este angulo de interpelacion, Alberto Giordano vuelve a los modos del ensayo del unico modo, o del modo mas eficaz, en que puede tener lugar esta vuelta: con etica y pulsion de ensayista. Esto es, dandole continuidad a la indagacion, afirmandose en esa insistencia, desde luego, pero tambien interrogandose sobre si sobre su objeto y sobre la justeza de su escritura-, experimentando el fracaso, reabriendo la lectura..."

Lo Mejor De Ernesto Sabato,,Ernesto Sabato,,5795,,,,,,,"En 1989 Ernesto Sabato reunió para Seix Barral lo que él juzgaba ""lo mejor"" de su obra. Tal selección incluye fragmentos de las novelas El túnel y Sobre héroes y tumbas y Abaddón el exterminador, y de los ensayos El escritor y sus fantasmas y Apologías y rechazos, y es, por su misma naturaleza, un volumen insustituible. Sól o el propio Sabato podía operar con tal libertad y tan seguro criterio en la selección de los materiales y en su presentación: ""He intentado ?nos dice Sabato? en el caso de las novelas, no dar fragmentos sueltos, sino acompañados de contextos que aseguran un mínimo de significado"". Así, Sabato configuró para esta antología un microcosmos de toda su creación que intencionadamente se cierra con un conciso, profundo y emotivo homenaje a Borges después de su muerte. Tratar de extender esta selección a los libros publicados por Sabato posteriormente sería desnaturalizarla: nadie podría reemplazar el criterio de Sabato respecto a títulos tan unitarios como Antes del fin y La resistencia, o tan variado como España en los diarios de mi vejez. Tal como está, Lo mejor de Ernesto Sabato tiene entidad propia, reúne con creces una representación de todos los libros que cimentaron la fama de su autor y constituye una creación autónoma, siendo así uno de sus títulos más reveladores y posiblemente su autorretrato más significativo. Nos hemos permitido añadir, a modo de apéndice, el prólogo escrito para el volumen Nunca más (también conocido como ?El informe Sabato?), que abría en 1984 la compilación de las conclusiones de la comisión que investigó los crímenes contra la humanidad cometidos por las juntas militares en Argentina entre 1976 y 1983, y que, presidida por Ernesto Sabato, fue creada a poco de hacerse cargo del gobierno Raúl Alfonsín. La extraordinaria trascendencia cívica y moral de este texto, de enorme resonancia en su momento, justifica sobradamente su inclusión aquí, pese a que Sabato ?probablemente en parte por modestia y en parte por la entonces muy dolorosa cercanía de los hechos? no lo había incluido. Sea por tanto la recuperación de este texto impresionante lo que complete nuestro homenaje a este autor que ?para emplear un adjetivo muy de su gusto y que a él puede aplicarse con toda justicia? podemos calificar de insobornable. Lo mejor de Ernesto Sabato es un libro fundamental, un libro extraordinario.<br />"

Within the context of the three theological virtues, faith, hope and love, Augustine masterfully covers the faith. He first works his way through the creed and then the Lords prayer as recorded by Matthew, ending with the sacraments. This is a colossal work in one small volume. Augustines Enchiridion On Faith, Hope and Charity, here called The Augustine Catechism, expresses his mature thinking and is an ideal introduction to studying his theologyhis teaching on the Trinity, the Church and the Sacraments, his doctrine of Original Sin and of redemption through Christ. It provides an admirable orientation to understanding his thought. Gerald Bonner Professor Emeritus Durham University Profound and complex in his theological vision, Augustine of Hippo could nonetheless synthesize and simplify when occasion needed.

When he began to write The City of God in 413, St. Augustine's intention was to defend the Christian Church against the charge of having brought about the Sack of Rome in 410. Outgrowing this initial purpose, the work evolved into a detailed critique of the political and moral tradition of Rome and a synthesis of Platonism and Christianity which must stand as one of the most significant achievements in Western intellectual history. Apart from its intrinsic interest the Christian account of social and political relations which Augustine gives was to furnish one of the most fertile sources of material for the controversial literature of the middle ages. R. W. Dyson has produced a complete, accurate, authoritative and fluent translation of The City of God, edited together with full biographical notes, a concise introduction, bibliographical note and chronology of Augustine's life."

This volume provides the Latin text of the first five books of the poem and the most detailed commentary available in English for these books. In his introduction to the volume, editor William S. Anderson provides essential background information, discussing Ovid’s life, the reception of the Metamorphoses during Ovid’s day and after, and the poem’s central issues. The Latin text of the five books is Anderson’s own edition, based on years of study of the surviving manuscripts. In the extensive notes that follow the text, Anderson offers both useful summaries of the stories and detailed line-by-line comments.<br /><br />Unlike other epic poems, which concern wars and heroism, the Metamorphoses centers on ordinary human beings, women as well as men, who live in a world of continuous change. The first five books, which include such well-known stories as Apollo and Daphane, Diana and Actaeon, and Narcissus and Echo, deal especially with the relationship between human beings and the gods. Arrogant and lustful, but all-powerful, the gods of Ovid’s universe selfishly pursue their own pleasures, frequently at the expense of their human targets. Yet these gods escape unscathed, while the humans, unjustly, are punished. Helpless to defend themselves, they are changed into animal or nonhuman forms.<br /><br />A resource for students and scholars of Latin, this volume enhances understanding and enjoyment of Ovid’s changeable poem about our changeable existence."

Two millennia later, the agonized, witty, vivid, nostalgic, and often slyly malicious poems he wrote at Tomis remain as fresh as the day they were written, a testament for exiles everywhere, in all ages.<br /><br />The two books of the <i>Poems of Exile, </i>the <i>Lamentations (Tristia) </i>and the <i>Black Sea Letters (Epistulae ex Ponto), </i>chronicle Ovid's impressions of Tomis—its appalling winters, bleak terrain, and sporadic raids by barbarous nomads—as well as his aching memories and ongoing appeals to his friends and his patient wife to intercede on his behalf. While pretending to have lost his old literary skills and even to be forgetting his Latin, in the <i>Poems of Exile </i>Ovid in fact displays all his virtuoso poetic talent, now concentrated on one objective: ending the exile. But his rhetorical message falls on obdurately deaf ears, and his appeals slowly lose hope.

"Singers, Heroes, and Gods in the Odyssey",,Charles Segal,,5872,,Cornell University Press,264,,,,"One of the special charms of the Odyssey, according to Charles Segal, is the way it transports readers to fascinating places. Yet despite the appeal of its narrative, the Odyssey is fully understood only when its style, design, and mythical patterns are taken into account as well. Bringing a new richness to interpretation of this epic, Segal looks closely at key forms of social and personal organization which Odysseus encounters in his voyages. Segal also considers such topics as the relationship between bard and audience, the implications of the Odyssey's self-consciousness about its own poetics, and Homer's treatment of the nature of poetry."
Tragedy and Civilization: An Interpretation of Sophocles,,Charles Segal,,5873,,University of Oklahoma Press,528,,,,"Drawing on comprehensive analyses of all of Sophocles’ plays, on structuralist anthropology, and on other extensive work on myth and tragedy, Charles Segal examines Sophocles both as a great dramatic poet and as a serious thinker. He shows how Sophoclean tragedy reflects the human condition in its constant and tragic struggle for order and civilized life against the ever-present threat of savagery and chaotic violence, both within society and within the individual. For this edition Segal also provides a new preface discussing recent developments in the study of Sophocles."
Dionysiac Poetics and Euripides' Bacchae,,Charles Segal,eng,5874,Expanded Edition,Princeton University Press,440,,,,"In his play <i>Bacchae</i>, Euripides chooses as his central figure the god who crosses the boundaries among god, man, and beast, between reality and imagination, and between art and madness. In so doing, he explores what in tragedy is able to reach beyond the social, ritual, and historical context from which tragedy itself rises. Charles Segal's reading of Euripides' <i>Bacchae</i> builds gradually from concrete details of cult, setting, and imagery to the work's implications for the nature of myth, language, and theater. This volume presents the argument that the Dionysiac poetics of the play characterize a world view and an art form that can admit logical contradictions and hold them in suspension."
Oedipus Tyrannus: Tragic Heroism and the Limits of Knowledge,,Charles Segal,,5875,,"Oxford University Press, USA",208,112704,Twayne's Masterwork Studies,108,"<em>Oedipus Tyrannus: Tragic Heroism and the Limits of Knowledge, 2/e</em>, is an accessible yet in-depth literary study of Sophocles' <em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em> (<em>Oedipus Rex</em>)--the most famous Greek tragedy and one of the greatest masterpieces of world literature. This unique volume combines a close, scene-by-scene literary analysis of the text with an account of the play's historical, intellectual, social, and mythical background and also discusses the play's place in the development of the myth and its use of the theatrical conventions of Greek drama. Based on a fresh scrutiny of the Greek text, this book offers a contemporary literary interpretation of the play, including a readable, nontechnical discussion of its underlying moral and philosophical issues; the role of the gods; the interaction of character, fate, and chance; the problem of suffering and meaning; and Sophocles' conception of tragedy and tragic heroism. This lucid guide traces interpretations of the play from antiquity to modern times--from Aristotle to Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Lacan, Levi-Strauss, Girard, and Vernant--and shows its central role in shaping the European conception of tragedy and modern notions of the self. This second edition draws on new approaches to the study of Greek tragedy; discusses the most recent interpretative scholarship on the play; and contains an annotated up-to-date bibliography. Ideal for courses in classical literature in translation, Greek drama, classical civilization, theater, and literature and arts, <em>Oedipus Tyrannus: Tragic Heroism and the Limits of Knowledge, 2/e</em>, will also reward general readers interested in literature and especially tragedy.<br />"

Lucretius on Death and Anxiety: Poetry and Philosophy in de Rerum Natura,,Charles Segal,,5878,,Princeton University Press,291,,,,"In a fresh interpretation of Lucretius's <i>On the Nature of Things</i>, Charles Segal reveals this great poetical account of Epicurean philosophy as an important and profound document for the history of Western attitudes toward death. He shows that this poem, aimed at promoting spiritual tranquillity, confronts two anxieties about death not addressed in Epicurus's abstract treatment--the fear of the process of dying and the fear of nothingness. Lucretius, Segal argues, deals more specifically with the body in dying because he draws on the Roman concern with corporeality as well as on the rich traditions of epic and tragic poetry on mortality.<br /><br />Segal explains how Lucretius's sensitivity to the vulnerability of the body's boundaries connects the deaths of individuals with the deaths of worlds, thereby placing human death into the poem's larger context of creative and destructive energies in the universe. The controversial ending of the poem, which describes the plague at Athens, is thus the natural culmination of a theme developed over the course of the work.<br /><br />Originally published in 1990.<br /><br />The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Segal provides close readings of the texts, and then studies the literary form and language of early Greek lyric, the poets' conception of their aims and their art, the use of mythical paradigms, and the relation of the poems to their social context. A recurrent theme is the recognition of the fragility and brevity of mortal happiness and the consciousness of how the immortality conferred by poetry resists the ever-threatening presence of death and oblivion, fixing in permanent form the passing moments of joy and beauty. This is an essential book for students and scholars of ancient Greek poetry."
"Sophocles' Tragic World: Divinity, Nature, Society",,Charles Segal,,5882,,Harvard University Press,276,,,,"Much has been written about the heroic figures of Sophocles' powerful dramas. Now Charles Segal focuses our attention not on individual heroes and heroines, but on the world that inspired and motivated their actions - a universe of family, city, nature, and the supernatural. He shows how these ancient masterpieces offer insight into the abiding question of tragedy: how one can make sense of a world that involves so much apparently meaningless violence and suffering. In a series of engagingly written interconnected essays, Segal studies five of Sophocles' seven extant plays: Ajax, Oedipus Tyrannus, Philoctetes, Antigone, and the often neglected Trachinian Women. He examines the language and structure of the plays from several interpretive perspectives, drawing both on traditional philological analysis and on current literary and cultural theory."
"Euripides and the Poetics of Sorrow: Art, Gender, and Commemoration in Alcestis, Hippolytus, and Hecuba",,Charles Segal,,5883,,Duke University Press Books,328,,,,"Where is the pleasure in tragedy? This question, how suffering and sorrow become the stuff of aesthetic delight, is at the center of Charles Segal's new book, which collects and expands his recent explorations of Euripides' art.<br /><i>Alcestis, Hippolytus</i>, and <i>Hecuba</i>, the three early plays interpreted here, are linked by common themes of violence, death, lamentation and mourning, and by their implicit definitions of male and female roles. Segal shows how these plays draw on ancient traditions of poetic and ritual commemoration, particularly epic song, and at the same time refashion these traditions into new forms. In place of the epic muse of martial glory, Euripides, Segal argues, evokes a muse of sorrows who transforms the suffering of individuals into a ""common grief for all the citizens,"" a community of shared feeling in the theater.<br /> Like his predecessors in tragedy, Euripides believes death, more than any other event, exposes the deepest truth of human nature. Segal examines the revealing final moments in <i>Alcestis, Hippolytus</i>, and <i>Hecuba</i>, and discusses the playwright's use of these deaths--especially those of women--to question traditional values and the familiar definitions of male heroism. Focusing on gender, the affective dimension of tragedy, and ritual mourning and commemoration, Segal develops and extends his earlier work on Greek drama. The result deepens our understanding of Euripides' art and of tragedy itself."

The Rhetoric Of Imitation: Genre And Poetic Memory In Virgil And Other Latin Poets,,Gian Biagio Conte,,5889,,,,,,,"This collection of essays offer a unified and coherent argument and point toward an important new approach in classical philology that challenges the dominant trends in Anglo-American criticism of Latin literature, which emphasize the autonomy of isolated texts or make extensive use of historical or sociological analysis.<br /><br />Gian Biagio Conte here seeks to establish a theoretical basis for explaining the ways in which Latin poets borrow from one another and echo one another. He stresses the systematic nature of literary discourse and its tendency to create systems of interrelated texts wherein each author's mode of assimilating and changing the tradition becomes a part of the tradition. Imitation, Conte asserts, should not be regarded merely as the inert confluence of historical circumstances but rather as a rhetorical figure in itself-and indeed as one of the major rhetorical devices of classical Latin poetry.<br /><br />The first half of the book establishes Conte's theoretical position; that position is then applied in detail to Virgil in the second half. Conte shows how Virgil, by contrasting bucolic and elegiac genres in Eclogue 10, effects a confrontation between different models of life. He discusses the Aeneid at length, demonstrating how Virgil modifies and transforms both Greek and Roman epic conventions. Virgil's ability to simultaneously maintain a plurality of points of view, Conte believes, made it possible for him to transcend the limits set by his predecessors and thereby to enrich the communicative and expressive range of the epic genre.<br /><br />These suggestive essays address important issues in the field of classical literature and interpretive method. They will find an appreciative audience among classicists and their students, comparativists, literary theorists, and anyone else concerned with the application of contemporary critical and semiotic theory to literary texts."

Einstein's Heroes: Imagining the World Through the Language of Mathematics,,Robyn Arianrhod,,5901,,"Oxford University Press, USA",323,,,,"Imagine you are fluent in a magical language of prophecy, a language so powerful it can accurately describe things you cannot see or even imagine. <em>Einstein's Heroes</em> takes you on a journey of discovery about just such a miraculous language--the language of mathematics--one of humanity's most amazing accomplishments.<br /> Blending science, history, and biography, this remarkable book reveals the mysteries of mathematics, focusing on the life and work of three of Albert Einstein's heroes: Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday, and especially James Clerk Maxwell, whose work directly inspired the theory of relativity. Robyn Arianrhod bridges the gap between science and literature, portraying mathematics as a language and arguing that a physical theory is a work of imagination involving the elegant and clever use of this language. The heart of the book illuminates how Maxwell, using the language of mathematics in a new and radical way, resolved the seemingly insoluble controversy between Faraday's idea of lines of force and Newton's theory of action-at-a-distance. In so doing, Maxwell not only produced the first complete mathematical description of electromagnetism, but actually predicted the existence of the radio wave, teasing it out of the mathematical language itself.<br /> Here then is a fascinating look at mathematics: its colorful characters, its historical intrigues, and above all its role as the uncannily accurate language of nature.<br />"

There are untold numbers of variations, imitations, alternate translations, and adaptations of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey,</i> making it difficult to establish what, exactly, the epics were. Gregory Nagy's essays have one central aim: to show how the text and language of Homer derive from an oral poetic system. <br />  <br /> In Homeric studies, there has been an ongoing debate centering on different ways to establish the text of Homer and the different ways to appreciate the poetry created in the language of Homer. Gregory Nagy, a lifelong Homer scholar, takes a stand in the midst of this debate. He presents an overview of millennia of scholarly engagement with Homer's poetry, shows the different editorial principles that have been applied to the texts, and evaluates their impact.<br />"

The Best of the Achaeans: Concepts of the Hero in Archaic Greek Poetry,,Gregory Nagy,,5909,,Johns Hopkins University Press,424,,,,"Despite widespread interest in the Greek hero as a cult figure, little was written about the relationship between the cult practices and the portrayals of the hero in poetry. The first edition of <i>The Best of the Achaeans</i> bridged that gap, raising new questions about what could be known or conjectured about Greek heroes. In this revised edition, which features a new preface by the author, Gregory Nagy reconsiders his conclusions in the light of the subsequent debate and resumes his discussion of the special status of heroes in ancient Greek life and poetry. His book remains an engaging introduction both to the concept of the hero in Hellenic civilization and to the poetic forms through which the hero is defined: the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> in particular and archaic Greek poetry in general."
Homeric Questions,,Gregory Nagy,,5910,,University of Texas Press,180,,,,"The Homeric Question has vexed scholars for centuries. Who was Homer, when and where did he live and was there more than one author of the Iliad and the Odyssey?. In this lively and innovative investiagtion the author, using the evidence of comparative linguistics and anthropology, puts forward a model which suggests that the poems as we know them today emerged from an evolutionary process in which composition, performance and the passage of time interacted. An important and provocative re-examination of the oral tradition."

The Iliad,"[{'id': '903', 'name': 'Homer', 'role': ''}, {'id': '573688', 'name': 'Robert Fitzgerald', 'role': 'Translator'}]",Homer,eng,3293141,,Everyman,594,,,,"An Iliad for the twenty-first century, this magnificent new translation by Stephen Mitchell sets the highest standards for beauty, accuracy, and aliveness. The power and the beauty of The Iliad resound again across 2,700 years in Stephen Mitchell's exciting new translation, as if the life blood of its heroes Achilles and Patroclus, Hector and Priam flowed in every word. And we are there with them amid the horror and ecstasy of war, carried along by a poetry that lifts even the most devastating human events into the realm of the beautiful.<br /><br />Based on the recent, superb M.L. West edition of the Greek, this Iliad is more readable and moving than any previous version. Whether it is his exciting recent version of Gilgamesh, with more than 150,000 copies sold, or his unmatched translation of the poet Rilke, still the standard after twenty-nine years, or his Tao Te Ching, which has sold more than 900,000 copies and itself been translated into six languages, Stephen Mitchell's books are international sensations. Now, thanks to his scholarship and poetic power, which re-creates the energy and simplicity, the speed, grace, and continual thrust and pull of the original, The Iliad 's ancient story bursts vividly into new life and will reach an even larger audience of readers.<br /><br />So, with elated hearts, they sat up all night<br /><br />on the battlefield, and their watchfires blazed all around them.<br /><br />As, in the night sky, around the light of the moon,<br /><br />the stars emerge, when the air is serene and windless,<br /><br />and the stars shine bright, and the heart of the shepherd rejoices:<br /><br />just so, before Ilion, the watchfires the Trojans had set<br /><br />blazed midway between the ships and the river Xanthus.<br /><br />A thousand watchfires were burning upon the plain,<br /><br />and around each, fifty men sat in the glow of the firelight,<br /><br />and the horses stood alongside the chariots, munching<br /><br />white barley and oats, and waited for dawn to arise."
Pindar's Homer: The Lyric Possession of an Epic Past,,Gregory Nagy,,5920,,Johns Hopkins University Press,414,,,,"Nagy challenges the widely held view that the development of lyric poetry in Greece represents the rise of individual innovation over collective tradition. Arguing that Greek lyric represents a tradition in its own right, Nagy shows how the form of Greek epic is in fact a differentiation of forms found in Greek lyric. Throughout, he progressively broadens the definition of lyric to the point where it becomes the basis for defining epic, rather than the other way around."
Plato's Rhapsody and Homer's Music: The Poetics of the Panathenaic Festival in Classical Athens,,Gregory Nagy,,5921,,Harvard University Press,136,,,,"The festival of the Panathenaia, held in Athens every summer to celebrate the birthday of the city's goddess, Athena, was the setting for performances of the Homeric <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> by professional reciters or ""rhapsodes."" The works of Plato are our main surviving source of information about these performances. Through his references, a crucial phase in the history of the Homeric tradition can be reconstructed. Through Plato's eyes, the ""staging"" of Homer in classical Athens can once again become a virtual reality.<br /><br />This book examines the overall testimony of Plato as an expert about the cultural legacy of these Homeric performances. Plato's fine ear for language--in this case the technical language of high-class artisans like rhapsodes--picks up on a variety of authentic expressions that echo the talk of rhapsodes as they once practiced their art.<br /><br />Highlighted among the works of Plato are the <i>Ion</i>, the <i>Timaeus</i>, and the <i>Critias</i>. Some experts who study the <i>Timaeus</i> have suggested that Plato must have intended this masterpiece, described by his characters as a <i>humnos</i>, to be a tribute to Athena. The metaphor of weaving, implicit in humnos and explicit in the peplos or robe that was offered to the goddess at the Panathenaia, applies also to Homeric poetry: it too was pictured as a <i>humnos</i>, destined for eternal re-weaving on the festive occasion of Athena's eternally self-renewing birthday."
"Language, Sexuality, Narrative: The Oresteia",,Simon Goldhill,,5922,,Cambridge University Press,328,,,,"This book is concerned with the complexity and difficulty of reading the Oresteia. It is not a traditional commentary, although it is often concerned with problems of interpretation and language, nor is it simply what is generally understood by a literary study, although it often discusses the wider themes of the narrative. It is a close reading of the text concentrating on the developing meanings of words within the structuring of the play. In particular, Simon Goldhill focuses on the text's interests in language and its control, in sexuality and sexual difference, and in the progression and description of events. Dr Goldhill links a sound philological knowledge with material drawn widely from modern literary theory and anthropological studies. The result is a challenging and provocative book, which offers for the serious student of Greek drama an exciting range of insights into one of the most important texts of the ancient world."
"Love, Sex & Tragedy: How the Ancient World Shapes Our Lives",,Simon Goldhill,eng,5923,,University of Chicago Press,345,,,,"In <i>Love, Sex &amp; Tragedy</i> Simon Goldhill lifts the veil on our inheritance of classical traditions and offers a witty, engrossing survey of the Greek and Roman roots of everything from our overwhelming mania for ""hard bodies"" to our political systems. Encompassing Karl Marx, Clark Gable, George W. Bush, Oscar Wilde, and Sigmund Freud, Goldhill takes great delight in tracing both follies and fundamental philosophical questions through the centuries and continents to the birthplace of Western civilization as we know it. Underlying his brisk and learned excursions through history and art is the foundational belief, following Cicero, that learning about the classics makes a critical difference to our self-understanding. Whether we are considering the role of religion in contemporary society, our expectations about the boundaries between public and private life, or even how we spend our free time, recognizing the role of the classics is integral to our comprehension of modern life and our place in it. <br /><br />""Confident, intelligent and assertive; [<i>Love, Sex &amp; Tragedy</i>] stands up for 'classics' without apology, without snobbishness and without conservatism.""—Oliver Taplin, <i>Guardian<br /></i><br />""Goldhill . . . takes us through the looking glass into antiquity and shows us some of the sights that he thinks most interesting and informative. . . . Anyone who goes on the journey will be amused, surprised, and enlightened.""—Mary K. Lefkowitz, <i>New York Sun <br /><br /></i>""A passionate, witty, and broad-ranging exploration of the ancient foundations of our world. . . . There is a widening gap between our perceptions and the ancient sources. Goldhill closes that gap with this lively and multi-layered challenge to assumptions embedded in modern life.""—Lizzie Speller,<i> Observer <br /><br /></i>"
Reading Greek Tragedy,,Simon Goldhill,eng,5924,,Cambridge University Press,302,,,,"This book is an advanced critical introduction to Greek tragedy. It is written specifically for the reader who does not know Greek and who may be unfamiliar with the context of the Athenian drama festival but who nevertheless wants to appreciate the plays in all their complexity. Simon Goldhill aims to combine the best contemporary scholarly criticism in classics with a wide knowledge of modern literary studies in other fields. He discusses the masterpieces of Athenian drama in the light of contemporary critical controversies in such a way as to enable the student or scholar not only to understand and appreciate the texts of the most commonly read plays, but also to evaluate and utilize the range of approaches to the problems of ancient drama."
The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature,,Simon Goldhill,,5925,,Cambridge University Press,384,,,,"""The object of this book,"" writes the author in his Preface, ""is to investigate how poetry and the figure of the poet are represented, discussed, contested within the poetry of ancient Greece."" Dr. Goldhill seeks to discover how ancient authors broached the questions: From what position does a poet speak? With what authority? With what debts to the past? With what involvement in the present? Through a series of interrelated essays on Homer, lyric poetry, Aristophanes, Theocritus and Apollonius of Rhodes, key aspects in the history of poetics are discussed: tale telling and the representation of man as the user of language; memorial and praise; parody, comedy and carnival; irony, masks and desire; the legacy of the past and the idea of influence. Detailed readings of major works of Greek literature show how richly rewarding and revealing this approach can be. The author makes liberal use of critical writings from areas of study other than Classics and focuses on problems central to contemporary critical debate. His book is uniquely placed to bring together modern and ancient poetics in a way that is enlightening for both. The work is written as much for the serious scholar of literary criticism as for the Classicist."

Who Needs Greek? Contests in the Cultural History of Hellenism,,Simon Goldhill,eng,5927,,Cambridge University Press,334,,,,"Who Needs Greek? is an interdisciplinary study of arguments on what ancient Greece has meant to western culture from the ancient world to today. The battles between artists and literary critics, historians and journalists, politicians and scholars, are often violent, hilarious, and always passionate. This cutting-edge cultural history ranges from ancient Greece via the Renaissance to modern opera, and treats a central question of culture in a way which will intrigue academics as well as a more general audience."
Foucault's Virginity: Ancient Erotic Fiction & the History of Sexuality (Stanford Memorial Lecture),,Simon Goldhill,eng,5928,,Cambridge University Press,212,289065,The W. B. Stanford Memorial Lectures,,"This is a study of how sex and sexuality were written about in the first centuries of this era, a central period in the history of sexuality. Writing with the same wit and verve as the ancient writers he engages with, Simon Goldhill shows how the standard accounts of sexuality in this period are distorted by ignoring the sexy, ironic and often bizarre texts of the ancient novel, erotic poetry and humorous dialogues."

  <div>The English National Opera Guides were originally conceived in partnership with the English National Opera and edited by Nicholas John, the ENO's dramaturg, who died tragically in an accident in the Alps. Most of the guides are devoted to a single opera, which is described in detailwith many articles that cover its history and information about the composer and his times. The complete libretto is included in both the original language and in a modern singing translationexcept where the opera was written in English. Each has a thematic guide to the most important musical themes in musical notation and each guide is lavishly illustrated. They also contain a bibliography and a discography which is updated at each reprint. The ENO guides are widely regarded as the best series of their kind and excellent value.</div>

2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl,,Daniel Pinchbeck,en-US,1349235,,Tarcher,408,,,,"Read Daniel Pinchbeck's posts on the Penguin Blog<br />Cross James Merrill, H. P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda -each imbued with a twenty-first-century aptitude for quantum theory and existential psychology-and you get the voice of Daniel Pinchbeck. And yet, nothing quite prepares us for the lucidity, rationale, and informed audacity of this seeker, skeptic, and cartographer of hidden realms. <br />Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck had been a member of New York's literary select. He wrote for publications such as ""The New York Times Magazine,"" ""Esquire,"" and ""Harper's Bazaar."" His first book, ""Breaking Open the Head,"" was heralded as the most significant on psychedelic experimentation since the work of Terence McKenna. <br />But slowly something happened: Rather than writing from a journalistic remove, Pinchbeck-his literary powers at their peak-began to participate in the shamanic and metaphysical belief systems he was encountering. As his psyche and body opened to new experience, disparate threads and occurrences made sense like never before: Humanity, every sign pointed, is precariously balanced between greater self-potential and environmental disaster. The Mayan calendar's ""end date"" of 2012 seems to define our present age: It heralds the end of one way of existence and the return of another, in which the serpent god Quetzalcoatl reigns anew, bringing with him an unimaginably ancient-yet, to us, wholly new-way of living. <br />A result not just of study but also of participation, ""2012"" tells the tale of a single man in whose trials we ultimately recognize our own hopes and anxieties about modern life."
Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey Into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism,"[{'id': '1201', 'name': 'Daniel Pinchbeck', 'role': ''}, {'id': '3850428', 'name': 'Lee Fukui', 'role': 'Designed by'}]",Daniel Pinchbeck,en-US,612781,,Crown Publishing Group (NY),336,,,,"<i>A dazzling work of personal travelogue and cultural criticism that ranges from the primitive to the postmodern in a quest for the promise and meaning of the psychedelic experience. </i><br /><br />While psychedelics of all sorts are demonized in America today, the visionary compounds found in plants are the spiritual sacraments of tribal cultures around the world. From the iboga of the Bwiti in Gabon, to the Mazatecs of Mexico, these plants are sacred because they awaken the mind to other levels of awareness--to a holographic vision of the universe.<br /><br /><i>Breaking Open the Head</i> is a passionate, multilayered, and sometimes rashly personal inquiry into this deep division. On one level, Daniel Pinchbeck tells the story of the encounters between the modern consciousness of the West and these sacramental substances, including such thinkers as Allen Ginsberg, Antonin Artaud, Walter Benjamin, and Terence McKenna, and a new underground of present-day ethnobotanists, chemists, psychonauts, and philosophers. It is also a scrupulous recording of the author's wide-ranging investigation with these outlaw compounds, including a thirty-hour tribal initiation in West Africa; an all-night encounter with the master shamans of the South American rain forest; and a report from a psychedelic utopia in the Black Rock Desert that is the Burning Man Festival.<br /><br /><i>Breaking Open the Head</i> is brave participatory journalism at its best, a vivid account of psychic and intellectual experiences that opened doors in the wall of Western rationalism and completed Daniel Pinchbeck's personal transformation from a jaded Manhattan journalist to shamanic initiate and grateful citizen of the cosmos."
A Psychonaut's Guide to the Invisible Landscape: The Topography of the Psychedelic Experience,,Dan Carpenter,,5939,,Park Street Press,128,,,,"A bold cartography of the inner landscape visible only to those experiencing altered states<br /><br />• Presents the psychedelic experience as an objective landscape that embodies the Other, rather than a subjective state of mind<br /><br />• Provides corroboration of phenomena encountered by those who venture into this domain<br /><br />Journeying into the invisible world revealed by his use of the dissociative psychedelic DXM (dextromethorphan), Dan Carpenter found that what he experienced was not simply subjective sensations and psychological states but an objective world of familiar, if inordinately odd, landmarks and characters. The running diary he kept of these voyages recounts impressions of a landscape charted by other travelers into this Inner Space and includes descriptions of many of the same phenomena recorded by such mind travelers as Terence and Dennis McKenna, Alexander and Ann Shulgin, and others who have experienced the hive mind--the pool of all consciousness. Into this territory where expression is like chaos theory, where oddly symmetrical order manifests out of the seemingly anarchic swirl of images and events, the author ventures with the mind-set of a naturalist, accepting whatever might be rather than what he hopes he might find. What emerges is not a location crafted by subjective experience, but a landscape that embodies the Other and that represents a conscious state in which the barriers between the self and the not-self dissolve."

Like a medieval tapestry of Nathaniel West’s Miss Lonelihearts drawn by Keith Haring on a Wacom tablet, Sam Brown weaves a story within a story, a fable entwined in a narrative of urban disenchantment and pastoral escape."

He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of <i>Into the Wild</i>.<br /><br />Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild."

In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that any job equals a better life. But how can anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6-$7 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich moved from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, taking the cheapest lodgings available and accepting work as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing home aide, and Wal-Mart salesperson. She soon discovered that even the ""lowliest"" occupations require exhausting mental and physical efforts. And one job is not enough; you need at least two if you intend to live indoors.<br /><br />Nickel and Dimed reveals low-wage America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity--a land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Instantly acclaimed for its insight, humor, and passion, this book is changing the way America perceives its working poor."

Maybe. But one $7-an-hour job won t pay the rent: she ll have to do back-to-back shifts, as a chambermaid and a waitress. This isn t the first surprise for acclaimed author Barbara, who set out to research low-wage life firsthand, confident she was prepared for the worst. Barbara Ehrenreich s best-seller about her odyssey is vivid and witty, yet always deeply sobering. Joan Holden s stage adaptation is a focused comic epic shadowed with tragedy. Barbara is prepared for hard work but not, at 55, for double shifts and nonstop aches and pains; for having to share tiny rooms, live on fast food because she has no place to cook, beg from food pantries, gulp handfuls of Ibuprofen because she can t afford a doctor; for failing, after all that, to make ends meet; or for constantly having to swallow humiliation. The worst, she learns, is not what happens to the back or the knees: it s the damage to the heart. The bright glimpses of Barbara s co-workers that enliven the book become indelible portraits: Gail, the star waitress pushing fifty who can no longer outrun her troubles; Carlie, the hotel maid whose rage has burned down to disgust; Pete, the nursing home cook who retreats into fantasy; Holly, terrified her pregnancy will end her job as Team Leader at Magic Maids, and with it her 50-cent raise. These characters wage their life struggles with a gallantry that humbles Barbara, and the audience. The play shows us the life a third of working Americans now lead, and makes us angry that anyone should have to live it."

So she did what millions of Americans do; she looked for a job and a place to live, worked that job and tried to make ends meet. </p><p>As a waitress in Florida, where her name is suddenly transposed to ""girl"", trailer trash becomes a demographic category to aspire to with rent at USD 675 per month. In Maine, where she ends up working as both a cleaner and a nursing home assistant, she must first fill out endless pre-employment tests with trick questions such as, ""Some people work better when they're a little bit high."" In Minnesota she works at Wal-Mart under the repressive surveillance of men and women whose job it is to monitor her behaviour for signs of sloth, theft, drug abuse, or worse. She even gets to experience the humiliation of the urine test. </p><p>So, do the poor have survival strategies unknown to the middle class? And did Ehrenreich feel the ""bracing psychological effects of getting out of the house, as promised by the people who brought us welfare reform?"" No, even in her best-case scenario, with all the advantages of education, health, a car, and money for first month's rent, she has to work two jobs, seven days a week and still almost ends up in a shelter.</p><p>As Ehrenreich points out with her potent combination of humour and outrage, the laws of supply and demand have been reversed. Rental prices skyrocket, but wages never rise. Rather, jobs are cheap in comparison to the pay that workers are encouraged to take as many as they can. Behind those trademark Wal-Mart vests, it turns out, are the borderline homeless.</p><p>With her characteristic wry wit and her unabashedly liberal bent, Ehrenreich brings the invisible poor out of hiding and, in the process, the world they inhabit where civil liberties are often ignored and hard work fails to live up to its reputation as the ticket out of poverty. --<i>Lesley Reed</i></p>"

Histories of Sexuality: Antiquity to Sexual Revolution,,Stephen Garton,,5996,,Routledge,,292607,Critical Histories of Subjectivity and Culture,,"This book presents the first assessment of one of the most rapidly expanding fields of research: the history of sexuality. From the early efforts of historians to work out a model for sexual history, to the extraordinary impact of French philosopher Michel Foucault, to the vigorous debates about essentialism and social constructionism, to the emergence of contemporary debates about historicism, queer theory, embodiment, gender and cultural history - we now have vast and diverse historical scholarship on sex and sexuality. 'Histories of Sexuality' highlights the key historical moments and issues: pederasty and cultures of male passivity in ancient Greece and Rome; the impact of early Christianity and ideals of renunciation on the sexual cultures of late antiquity; the sustained existence of homosexual cultures in medieval and renaissance Europe; the ""invention"" of homosexuality and heterosexuality in eighteenth century Europe and America; the truth behind Victorian sexual repression; the work of reformers and scientists such as Havelock Ellis, Marie Stopes, Stella Browne, Margaret Sanger, Alfred Kinsey, William Masters and Virginia Johnson."

In search of new Arctic hunting grounds, Albanov's ship, the Saint Anna, was frozen fast in the pack ice of the treacherous Kara Sea-a misfortune grievously compounded by an incompetent commander, the absence of crucial nautical charts, insufficient fuel, and inadequate provisions that left the crew weak and debilitated by scurvy.<br /><br />For nearly a year and a half, the twenty-five men and one woman aboard the Saint Anna endured terrible hardships and danger as the icebound ship drifted helplessly north. Convinced that the Saint Anna would never free herself from the ice, Albanov and thirteen crewmen left the ship in January 1914, hauling makeshift sledges and kayaks behind them across the frozen sea, hoping to reach the distant coast of Franz Josef Land. With only a shockingly inaccurate map to guide him, Albanov led his men on a 235-mile journey of continuous peril, enduring blizzards, disintegrating ice floes, attacks by polar bears and walrus, starvation, sickness, snowblindness, and mutiny. That any of the team survived is a wonder. That Albanov kept a diary of his ninety-day ordeal-a story that Jon Krakauer calls an ""astounding, utterly compelling book,"" and David Roberts calls ""as lean and taut as a good thriller""-is nearly miraculous.<br /><br />First published in Russia in 1917, Albanov's narrative is here translated into English for the first time.

This is the first and only true telling of Ms. Rowling's history because it is in her own words, from her birth in Chipping Sodbury near Bristol, England, to the stories about her favorite and least favorite teachers in school growing up, and to the funny misunderstanding in her first fan letter. It is like a visit with a friend, a friend who has brought you to tears with laughter and told the most enchanting stories you've ever been told."
J.K. Rowling,,Ann Gaines,,6072,,Mitchell Lane Publishers,32,,,,"Joanne Kathleen Rowling (a.k.a. J. K. Rowling) had always wanted to be a writer. In fact, she never knew what else she wanted to do with her life. She wandered from job to job before she thought up Harry Potter and the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was ecstatic when Bloomsbury Press offered to publish her book for a few thousand dollars. But the success of the book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, took everyone by surprise. Since then she has gone on to publish six more books in the series and they have all been made into major motion pictures. Faced with almost overnight fame and fortune, Jo (as she likes to be called ) still stays grounded. She readily admits that the most important thing to her is spending time with her husband and raising their children.

Abandonados por la máquina inteligente de la Nave que los llevó hasta Pandora, diezmados por los efectos de una mutación genética inducida deliberadamente, los colonos humanos tuvieron que enfrentarse a una tremenda lucha para sobrevivir, acabando por destruir el planeta ... y descubrir, a sus propias expensas, que el varec regulaba la turbulencia de los océanos. <br /><br />Ahora, las olas han erosionado los continentes hasta el punto de convertir Pandora en una mar inmenso, único y turbulento.

(Boston),,,,,"s/t: Edited on the Basis of Kock`s Edition<br />Aristophanes was a Greek comic playwright. A satirist, he used the freedom of Old Comedy to ridicule public figures, institutions, even the gods. The Clouds (Νεφέλαι) lampoons intellectual fashions in classical Athens. It was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423 BC &amp; wasn't well received, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival. It was revised between 420-417. Thereafter it was circulated in manuscript form. No copy of the original production survives. Scholarly analysis indicates that the revised version is an incomplete form of Old Comedy. This incompleteness isn't obvious in modern translations &amp; performances. The Clouds can be considered not only the first extant 'comedy of ideas' but also a successful example of that genre. The play gained notoriety for its caricature of Socrates ever since its mention in Plato's Apology as a factor contributing to his trial.<br /> The plot is simple. A man belonging to the once sound &amp; uncorrupted core of the people, a countryman, who's suffered material &amp; moral ruin thru evils common to the times, tho not yet himself attacked by the poison of the new culture, is led by adverse circumstances to embrace it. He's been wealthy, &amp; could have enjoyed his property in peace, but want of character have involved him in a series of misfortunes.

In the process, he transformed both crime writing and the American language.<br /><br />Written during the war, <em>The Lady in the Lake</em> (1943) takes Philip Marlowe out of the seamy L.A. streets to the deceptive tranquility of the surrounding mountains, as the search for a businessman’s missing wife expands into an elegy of loneliness and loss. The darker tone typical of Chandler’s later fiction is evident in <em>The Little Sister</em> (1949), in which an ambitious starlet, a blackmailer, and a seemingly naïve young woman from Manhattan, Kansas, are the key players in a plot that provides fuel for a bitter indictment of Hollywood and Chandler’s most savage portrayal of his adopted city.<br /><br /><em>The Long Goodbye</em> (1953), his most ambitious and self-revealing novel, uncovers a more anguished resonance in the Marlowe character, in a plot that hinges on the betrayal of friendship and the compromises of middle age. <em>Playback</em> (1958), written originally as a screenplay, is Chandler’s seventh and last novel.<br /><br />A special feature of this volume is Chandler’s long-unavailable screenplay for the film noir classic, <em>Double Indemnity</em> (1944), adapted from James M. Cain’s novel. Written with director Billy Wilder, it is one of the best screenplays in American cinema, masterful in construction and dialogue.

Now Chandler joins the authoritative <em>Library of America</em> series in a comprehensive two-volume set displaying all the facets of his brilliant talent.<br /><br />In his first novel, <em>The Big Sleep</em> (1939), the classic private eye finds his full-fledged form as Philip Marlowe: at once tough, independent, brash, disillusioned, and sensitive—and man of weary honor threading his way (in Chandler’s phrase) “down these mean streets” among blackmailers, pornographers, and murderers for hire.<br /><br />In <em>Farewell, My Lovely</em> (1940), Chandler’s personal favorite among his novels, Marlowe’s search for a missing woman leads him from shanties and honky-tonks to the highest reaches of power, encountering an array of richly drawn characters. <em>The High Window</em> (1942), about a rare coin that becomes a catalyst by which a hushed-up crime comes back to haunt a wealthy family, is partly a humorous burlesque of pulp fiction. All three novels show Chandler at a peak of verbal inventiveness and storytelling drive<br /><br /><em>Stories and Early Novels</em> also includes every classic noir story from the 1930s that Chandler did not later incorporate into a novel—thirteen in all, among them such classics as “Red Wind,” “Finger Man,” The King in Yellow,"" and “Trouble Is My Business.” Drawn from the pages of <em>Black Mask</em> and <em>Dime Detective</em>, these stories show how Chandler adapted the violent conventions of the pulp magazine—with their brisk exposition and rapid-fire dialogue—to his own emerging vision of 20th-century America."

These stories are where Chandler honed his art and developed his uniquely vivid underworld, peopled with good cops and bad cops, informers and extortionists, lethally predatory blondes and redheads, and crime, sex, gambling, and alcohol in abundance. In addition to his classic hard-boiled stories–in which his signature atmosphere of depravity and violence swirls around the cool, intuitive loners whose type culminated in the famous detective Philip Marlowe–Chandler also turned his hand to fantasy and even a gothic romance. <br /><br />This rich treasury of twenty-five stories shows Chandler developing the terse, laconic, understated style that would serve him so well in his later masterpieces, and immerses the reader in the richly realized fictional universe that has become an enduring part of our literary landscape"

""Alzheimer's,"" she writes, ""snips away at the threads, a slow unraveling, a steady retreat; as a witness all you can do is watch, cry, and whisper a soft stream of goodbyes.""She writes of needing to be reunited at forty-two with her mother, of regaining what they had spent decades demolishing. A truce was necessary to bring together a splintered family, a few weeks before her father released his letter telling the country and the world of his illness. She delves into her memories to touch her father again, to hear his voice, to keep alive the years she had with him."

"Workers, Neighbors, and Citizens: The Revolution in Mexico City",,John Lear,,6135,,University of Nebraska Press,441,,,,"<i>Workers, Neighbors, and Citizens</i> examines the mobilization of workers and the urban poor in Mexico City from the eve of the 1910 revolution through the early 1920s, producing for the first time a nuanced illumination of groups that have long been discounted by historians. John Lear addresses a basic paradox: During one of the great social upheavals of the twentieth century, urban workers and masses had a limited military role, yet they emerged from the revolution with considerable combativeness and a new significance in the power structure. Lear identifies a significant and largely underestimated tradition of resistance and independent organization among working people that resulted in part from the changes in the structure of class and community in Mexico City during the last decades of Porfirio Diaz's rule (1876–1910). This tradition of resistance helped to join skilled workers and the urban poor as they embraced organizational opportunities and faced crises in wages and access to food and housing as the revolution escalated. Emblematic of these ties was the role of women in political agitation, street mobilizations, strikes, and riots. Lear suggests that the prominence of labor after the revolution was neither a product of opportunism nor one of revolutionary consciousness, but rather the result of the ongoing organizational efforts and cultural transformations of working people that coincided with the revolution."

"Happiness, Death, and the Remainder of Life",,Jonathan Lear,,97705,,Harvard University Press,,,,,"Separated by millennia, Aristotle and Sigmund Freud gave us disparate but compelling pictures of the human condition. But if, with Jonathan Lear, we scrutinize these thinkers' attempts to explain human behavior in terms of a higher principle--whether happiness or death--the pictures fall apart. Aristotle attempted to ground ethical life in human striving for happiness, yet he didn't understand what happiness is any better than we do. Happiness became an enigmatic, always unattainable, means of seducing humankind into living an ethical life. Freud fared no better when he tried to ground human striving, aggression, and destructiveness in the death drive, like Aristotle attributing purpose where none exists. Neither overarching principle can guide or govern ""the remainder of life,"" in which our inherently disruptive unconscious moves in breaks and swerves to affect who and how we are. Lear exposes this tendency to self-disruption for what it is: an opening, an opportunity for new possibilities. His insights have profound consequences not only for analysis but for our understanding of civilization and its discontent."

Its author's engaging voice is one reason, and the compelling subjects he addresses is another; the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, the history and future of the universe. But it is also true that in the years since its publication, readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book's most important concepts. <br /><br />This is the origin of and the reason for A Briefer History of Time: its author's wish to make its content more accessible to readers - as well as to bring it up-to-date with the latest scientific observations and findings.<br /><br />Although this book is literally somewhat ""briefer"", it actually expands on the great subjects of the original. Purely technical concepts, such as the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions, are gone. Conversely, subjects of wide interest that were difficult to follow because they were interspersed throughout the book have now been given entire chapters of their own, including relativity, curved space, and quantum theory.<br /><br />This reorganization has allowed the authors to expand areas of special interest and recent progress, from the latest developments in string theory to exciting developments in the search for a complete unified theory of all the forces of physics. Like prior editions of the book - but even more so - A Briefer History of Time will guide nonscientists everywhere in the ongoing search for the tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space. <br /><br />Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating addition in its own right to the literature of science."

This fascinating book insightfully surveys the relationship of science, reason, and religion, giving special attention to the most contentious topics -- cosmology, evolution, and miracles.<br /><br />Providing a superb introduction to the philosophy of science, Dowe's <i>Galileo, Darwin, and Hawking</i> contends that there are four basic ways to relate science and religion. Two of them, <i>naturalism</i> and <i>religious science</i>, present these endeavors as antagonistic. By contrast, an <i>independence</i> view understands them as wholly unrelated. Finally, an <i>interaction</i> account sees religion and science as complementary -- perhaps even dependent on one another.

But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein's general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united in a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? On this issue, two of the world's most famous physicists--Stephen Hawking (""A Brief History of Time"") and Roger Penrose (""The Emperor's New Mind"" and ""Shadows of the Mind"")--disagree. Here they explain their positions in a work based on six lectures with a final debate, all originally presented at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge.<br /><br />How could quantum gravity, a theory that could explain the earlier moments of the big bang and the physics of the enigmatic objects known as black holes, be constructed? Why does our patch of the universe look just as Einstein predicted, with no hint of quantum effects in sight? What strange quantum processes can cause black holes to evaporate, and what happens to all the information that they swallow? Why does time go forward, not backward?<br /><br />In this book, the two opponents touch on all these questions. Penrose, like Einstein, refuses to believe that quantum mechanics is a final theory. Hawking thinks otherwise, and argues that general relativity simply cannot account for how the universe began. Only a quantum theory of gravity, coupled with the no-boundary hypothesis, can ever hope to explain adequately what little we can observe about our universe. Penrose, playing the realist to Hawking's positivist, thinks that the universe is unbounded and will expand forever. The universe can be understood, he argues, in terms of the geometry of light cones, the compression and distortion of spacetime, and by the use of twistor theory. With the final debate, the reader will come to realize how much Hawking and Penrose diverge in their opinions of the ultimate quest to combine quantum mechanics and relativity, and how differently they have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible."

Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great ""we"" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--""I."""
Atlas Shrugged & The Fountainhead,,Ayn Rand,,817229,,,,,,,"Two great novels that will change the way you look at the world.<br /><br /><b>Atlas Shrugged</b> is the astounding story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world--and did. Tremendous in scope, breathtaking in its suspense, <b>Atlas Shrugged</b> stretches the boundaries further than any book you have ever read. It is a mystery, not about the murder of a man's body, but about the murder--and rebirth--of man's spirit.<br /><br /><b>The Fountainhead</b> has become an enduring piece of literature, more popular now than when published in 1943. On the surface, it is a story of one man, Howard Roark, and his struggles as an architect in the face of a successful rival, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. But the book addresses a number of universal themes: the strength of the individual, the tug between good and evil, the threat of fascism. The confrontation of those themes, along with the amazing stroke of Rand's writing, combine to give this book its enduring influence."

Was Wright the inspiration for Howard Roark, the architect hero of Rand's The Fountainhead? What can be made of their collaboration on the book's failed 1944 movie adaptation, and what can be gleaned from the 1949 Hollywood production of The Fountainhead? Where does the FBI - Wright was dubbed a communist sympathizer, and Rand was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee - fit into the story? Art, architecture, philosophy, film and politics come together in this exploration, which relies on the writings of Wright and Rand, FBI files, visual evidence and more to cement their connection. both the failed production of The Fountainhead and the successful one, and the effect FBI harassment had on the movie and on their lives. Subsequent chapters discuss Wright's place as a Hollywood architect, and offer telling set designs and architectural images from the 1949 production of The Fountainhead. Several appendices supplement the illustrated text, and there is a filmography of movies mentioned in the book. A bibliography and index are also included."

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? <br /><br />In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. <br /><br />Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make.

Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of ""thin slices"" of behavior. The key is to rely on our ""adaptive unconscious""--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <br />Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us ""mind blind,"" focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to ""the Warren Harding Effect"" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the ""dark side of blink,"" he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. In this brilliant, cage-rattling book, one can only wish for a thicker slice of Gladwell's ideas about what Blink Camp might look like. --Barbara Mackoff"

Although several books have been written about this surprising event, known as the Cambrian explosion, none has explained why it occurred. Indeed, none was able to. Here, for the first time, Oxford zoologist Andrew Parker reveals his theory of this great flourishing of life.

Chapman's fine new edition has, among its other merits, the advantage of waking the Jane Austenite up.... The novels continue to live their own wonderful internal life...freshened and enriched by contact with the life of facts. His illustrations are beyond all praise.""--E.M. Forster, <em>Abinger Harvest</em>.<br /><br />This beautiful set provides the definitive text of Austen's six great comic masterpieces <em>and</em> her minor works (the latter include three high-spirited efforts written at about age fifteen; a charming fragment, <em>The Watsons</em>, which has been thought to be a sketch for <em>Emma</em>; and a tantalizing fragment, <em>Sanditon</em>, written in the last year of her life). All six volumes feature splendid early 19th-century illustrations as well as Chapman's detailed explanatory notes. Chapman has collated all the editions published in the author's lifetime and previously unpublished manuscripts, establishing an authoritative text that retains the punctuation, the spelling, and division into volumes of the originals. In addition, at the end of each work he supplies notes on textual matters and appendixes on such matters as the modes of address, or characters, or carriages and travel, as these seem warranted by the text. Additional changes have been incorporated by Mary Lascelles.<br />"

They bring alive her family and friends, her surroundings and contemporary events with a freshness unparalleled in modern biographies. Above all we recognize the unmistakable voice of the author of such novels as Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. We see the shift in her writing from witty and amusing descriptions of the social life of town and country, to a thoughtful and constructive tone while writing about the business of literary composition.<br /> R.W. Chapman's ground-breaking edition of the collected Letters first appeared in 1932, and a second edition followed twenty years later. Now in this third edition of Jane Austen's Letters, Deirdre Le Faye has added new material that has come to light since 1952, and re-ordered the letters into their correct chronological sequence. She has provided discreet and full annotation to each letter, including its provenance, and information on the watermarks, postmarks, and other physical details of the manuscripts, together with new biographical, topographical, and general indexes.

Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?<br /><br />Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of <i>Persuasion</i> will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work."

Flaubert: A Biography,,Frederick Brown,,6205,,"Little, Brown and Company",640,,,,"Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880), whose <i>Madame Bovary</i> outraged the right-thinking bourgeoisie when it was first published in 1856, is brought to life here in all his singularity and brilliance. Frederick Brown's insightful portrayal is of an artist fraught with contradictions, his wit and bravado merging into vulnerability. A sedentary man by nature, Flaubert undertook epic voyages through Egypt and the Middle East. He could be flamboyantly uncouth but was fanatically devoted to beautifully cadenced prose. While energized by his camaraderie with male friends, who included Turgenev, the Goncourt brothers, Zola, and Maupassant, he depended upon the emotional nurture of maternal women, notably George Sand. His assorted mistresses--French, Egyptian, and English--fed his richly erotic imagination and found their way into his fictional characters.<br /><br />Flaubert's time and place caused him to be literally put on trial for portraying lewd behavior in <i>Madame Bovary</i>. His milieu also made him a celebrity and, indirectly, brought about his financial ruin, probably hastening his sudden death at the the age of fifty-nine. Although writing was something like torture for him, it preoccupied his mind and dominated his life. He privately dreamed of popular success, which he in fact achieved with <i>Madame Bovary</i>, but adamantly refused to sacrifice to it his ideal of artistic integrity. About Flaubert's life, inner world, times, and legacy, Frederick Brown's magisterial biography is a revelation."

An ardent devourer of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment, and when real life continues to fail to live up to her romantic expectations, the consequences are devastating. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: 'Madame Bovary, c'est moi.'<br /><br />This modern translation by Flaubert's biographer, Geoffrey Wall, retains all the delicacy and precision of the French original. The edition also contains a preface by the novelist Michèle Roberts."

It went on to garner widespread critical acclaim and to win an American Book Award for Translation.<br /><br />Now, in the second volume, we see Flaubert in the years of his fame--the years in which he wrote <i>Salammb�</i>, <i>L'�ducation sentimentale</i>, <i>The Temptation of Saint Anthony</i>, <i>Three Tales</i>, and the unfinished <i>Bouvard and Pecuchet</i>. In writing the novels, Flaubert followed his precept, ""An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere,"" but in these letters of his maturity he gives full scope to his feelings and expresses forceful opinions on matters public and private.<br /><br />We see Flaubert traveling to Tunisia to document the exotic Salammb�, then calling on his own memories and those of his friends to bring to life the Revolution of 1848 and the loves of his hero Frederic Moreau in the pages of <i>L'�ducation sentimentale</i>, which many today consider his greatest novel. Flaubert is taken up by the Second Empire Court of Napoleon III and Eugenie, and becomes a lifelong friend of Princess Mathilde Bonaparte. But the most powerful feminine presence in this volume is the warm, sympathetic George Sand, with whom he maintains a fascinating correspondence for more than ten years. This dialogue on life, letters, and politics between the ""two troubadours,"" as they called themselves, reveals both of them at their idiosyncratic best.<br /><br />The deaths of Flaubert's mother, of his closest friend and mentor, Louis Bouilhet, and of Th�ophile Gautier, Sainte-Beuve, and other intimates, and Flaubert's financial ruin at the hands of his beloved niece Caroline and her rapacious husband, make a somber story of the post war years. Despite these and other losses, Flaubert's last years are brightened by the affection of Guy de Maupassant, Zola, and other younger writers.<br /><br />Together with Francis Steegmuller's masterly connecting narrative and essential annotation, these letters, most of which appear here in English for the first time, constitute an intimate and engrossing new biography of the great master of the modern novel."

His aspirations take a romantic turn upon a chance encounter with a married woman, who inspires a lifelong obsession.

Because its devastating humor and irony are often dependent on the phrasing in vernacular French, the Dictionnaire was long considered untranslatable. This notion was taken as a challenge by Jacques Barzun. Determined to find the exact English equivalent for each “accepted idea” Flaubert recorded, he has succeeded in documenting our own inanities.

""A Mouth Like Yours"" tells of a third and grand collision, with the vulnerable, volatile, and addictive Joanie Artois. <br />So quickly does Harper lose himself in Joanie, so thoroughly does she colonize his heart, that he sets out to understand why, exactly, love always unmans him this way. Exploring what carnal love can do for us and what it cannot, ""A Mouth Like Yours"" is a poignant statement about the growing pains of a generation.<br />"

Looking for Mo,,Daniel Duane,,6222,,Washington Square Press,240,,,,"A ""fresh, funny first novel"" ""(San Francisco Chronicle),"" ""Looking For Mo"" has garnered rave reviews from critics and readers alike, echoing the success of Daniel Duane's previous book, ""Caught Inside."" This time Duane combines the thrill of adventure writing ""a la"" Jon Krakauer with a sly satire of pop culture comparable to Douglas Coupland's ""Generation X,"" and folds them into a wry and memorable story of one man's search for truth on the sheer rock face of Yosemite's El Capitan. Raymond Connelly, a San Francisco would-be writer, is still living uneasily with his failure to climb ""The Captain"" with his childhood friend and alter ego, Mo Lehrman. As he circumnavigates his way through life on the edges of West Coast counterculture, trying to live like Mo's stories, which are more real than life itself, Ray lifts the best of those tales for his own book. But when he is accused of plagiarism, Ray suffers an attack of conscience, and sets off in search of Mo -- to explain, and to make good by finishing their shared climb.<br /><br />From the San Francisco performance-art world to a psychedelic vision at a Grateful Dead show, Ray's quest for self-discovery is both hilarious and emotionally fraught, climaxing in two men's true-to-life climb up the sheer slope of ""The Captain."" ""Looking For Mo"" is a moving, resonant exploration of the tenuous foundations of friendship and an investigation of the explosive power of storytelling."

John Adams,,David McCullough,eng,963375,,Simon & Schuster Paperbacks,751,,,,"The enthralling, often surprising story of John Adams, one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.<br /><br />In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. <br /><br />Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. <br /><br />As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. <br /><br />Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. <br /><br />At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. <br /><br />Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. <br /><br />It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. <br /><br />This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived."

In this Annual Gandhi Lecture for the International Association of Gandhian Studies, Mark Shepard tackles some persistently wrong-headed views of Gandhi, offering us a more accurate picture of the man and his nonviolence.<br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Mark Shepard is the author of ""Mahatma Gandhi and His Myths,"" ""The Community of the Ark,"" and ""Gandhi Today,"" called by the American Library Association's Booklist ""a masterpiece of committed reporting.""

It would be [some] of the most valuable pages many people could read about Gandhi."" -- Global Conscience, July-Sept. 1990<br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />SAMPLE<br /><br />I suspect that most of the myths and misconceptions surrounding Gandhi have to do with nonviolence. For instance, it's surprising how many people still have the idea that nonviolent action is passive.<br /><br />It's important for us to be clear about this: There is nothing passive about Gandhian nonviolent action.<br /><br />I'm afraid Gandhi himself helped create this confusion by referring to his method at first as ""passive resistance,"" because it was in some ways like techniques bearing that label. But he soon changed his mind and rejected the term.<br /><br />Gandhi's nonviolent action was not an evasive strategy nor a defensive one. Gandhi was always on the offensive. He believed in confronting his opponents aggressively, in such a way that they could not avoid dealing with him.<br /><br />But wasn't Gandhi's nonviolent action designed to avoid violence? Yes and no. Gandhi steadfastly avoided violence toward his opponents. He did not avoid violence toward himself or his followers.<br /><br />Gandhi said that the nonviolent activist, like any soldier, had to be ready to die for the cause. And in fact, during India's struggle for independence, hundreds of Indians were killed by the British.<br /><br />The difference was that the nonviolent activist, while willing to die, was never willing to kill.<br /><br />Gandhi pointed out three possible responses to oppression and injustice. One he described as the coward's way: to accept the wrong or run away from it. The second option was to stand and fight by force of arms. Gandhi said this was better than acceptance or running away.<br /><br />But the third way, he said, was best of all and required the most courage: to stand and fight solely by nonviolent means."

A lanky kid from Plano, Texas, is raised by a feisty, single parent who sacrifices for her son, who becomes one of our country's greatest athletes. Given that background, it is understandable why Armstrong was able to channel his boundless energy toward athletic endeavors. By his senior year in high school, he was already a professional triathlete and was training with the U.S. Olympic cycling developmental team. In 1993, Armstrong secured a position in the ranks of world-class cyclists by winning the World Championship and a Tour de France stage, but in 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Armstrong entered an unknown battlefield and challenged it as if climbing through the Alps: aggressive yet tactical. He beat the cancer and proceeded to stun all the pundits by winning the 1999 Tour de France. In this memoir, Armstrong covers his early years swiftly with a blunt matter-of-factness, but the main focus is on his battle with cancer. Readers will respond to the inspirational recovery story, and they will appreciate the behind-the-scenes cycling information.

In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man—a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined—but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman’s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman’s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary “man from Missouri” who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history."

"Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software",,Steven Johnson,en-US,931923,,Scribner,288,,,,"In the tradition of <i>Being Digital</i> and <i>The Tipping Point,</i> Steven Johnson, acclaimed as a ""cultural critic with a poet's heart"" <i>(The Village Voice),</i> takes readers on an eye-opening journey through emergence theory and its applications. Explaining why the whole is sometimes smarter than the sum of its parts, Johnson presents surprising examples of feedback, self-organization, and adaptive learning. How does a lively neighborhood evolve out of a disconnected group of shopkeepers, bartenders, and real estate developers? How does a media event take on a life of its own? How will new software programs create an intelligent World Wide Web? <p> In the coming years, the power of self-organization -- coupled with the connective technology of the Internet -- will usher in a revolution every bit as significant as the introduction of electricity. Provocative and engaging, <i>Emergence</i> puts you on the front lines of this exciting upheaval in science and thought.</p>"

The House of Mirth / The Reef / The Custom of the Country / The Age of Innocence,"[{'id': '16', 'name': 'Edith Wharton', 'role': ''}, {'id': '145662', 'name': 'R.W.B. Lewis', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Edith Wharton,eng,18980888,,Library of America,1328,,,,"Edith Wharton’s full and glamorous life bridged the literary worlds of two continents and two centuries. Born in 1862 into an exclusive New York society against whose rigid codes of behavior she often rebelled, she lived to regret the passing of that stable if old-fashioned community and to appreciate the sense of personal identity its definitions provided. She became a prolific professional writer, author of more than forty published volumes, including novels, short stories (many of them tales of the supernatural), poetry, war reportage, travel writing, and books on gardens and house decoration. An expatriate in France for three decades before her death in 1937, she included among her many distinguished friends men as various as Henry James, Theodore Roosevelt, Kenneth Clark, and André Gide.<br /><br />The four novels in this <em>Library of America</em> volume show Wharton at the height of her powers as a social observer and critic, examining American and European lives with a vision rich in detail, satire, and tragedy. In all of them her strong and autobiographical impulse is disciplined by her writer’s craft and her unfailing regard for her audience.<br /><br /><em>The House of Mirth</em> (1905), Wharton’s tenth book and her first novel of contemporary life, was an immediate runaway bestseller, with 140,000 copies in print within three months of publication. The story of young Lily Bart and her tragic sojourn among the upper class of turn-of-the-century New York, it touches on the insidious effects of social convention and upon the sexual and financial aggression to which women of independent spirit were exposed.<br /><br /><em>The Reef</em> (1912) is the story of two couples whose marriage plans are upset by the revelation of a past affair between George Darrow (a mature bachelor) and Sophy Vener, who happens to be the fiancée of his future wife’s stepson. Henry James called the novel “a triumph of method,” and it shares the rich nuance of his own <em>The Golden Bowl</em>.<br /><br /><em>The Custom of the Country</em> (1913) is the amatory saga of Undine Spragg of Apex City—beautiful, spoiled, and ambitious—whose charms conquer New York and European society. Vulgar and voracious, she presides over a series of men, representing the old and new aristocracies of both continents, in a comedy drawn unmistakably from life.<br /><br /><em>The Age of Innocence</em> (1920) is set in the New York of Wharton’s youth, when the rules and taboos of her social “tribe” held as-yet unchallenged sway. A quasi-anthropological study of a remembered culture and its curious conventions, it tells the story of the Countess Olenska (formerly Ellen Mingott), refugee from a disastrous European marriage, and Newland Archer, heir to a tradition of respectability and family honor, as they struggle uneasily against their sexual attraction."
"Collected Stories, 1911-1937","[{'id': '16', 'name': 'Edith Wharton', 'role': ''}, {'id': '26993', 'name': 'Maureen Howard', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Edith Wharton,eng,6323,,Library of America,848,,,,"A master of the American short story, in a two-volume collector's edition<br /><br />Over the course of a long and astonishingly productive literary career that stretched from the early 1890s to just before World War II, Edith Wharton published nearly a dozen story collections, leaving a body of work as various as it is enduring. With this two-volume set, The Library of America presents the finest of Wharton's achievement in short fiction: 67 stories drawn from the entire span of her writing life, including the novella-length works <i>The Touchstone</i>, <i>Sanctuary</i>, and <i>Bunner Sisters</i>, eight shorter pieces never collected by Wharton, and many stories long out-of-print.<br /><br />Her range of setting and subject matter is dazzling, and her mastery of style consistently sure. Here are all the aspects of Wharton's art: her satire, sometimes gentle, sometimes dark and despairing, of upper-class manners; her unblinking recognition of the power of social convention and the limits of passion; her merciless exposure of commercial motivations; her candid exploration of relations between the sexes.<br /><br />The stories range with cosmopolitan ease from her native New York to the salons and summer hotels of Newport, Paris, and the Italian lakes. The depth of her response to World War I is registered in such works as ""The Marne."" Of particular interest are the remarkable stories, which treat occult and supernatural themes rarely encountered in her novels, such as the classic ghost stories ""The Eyes"" and ""Pomegranate Seed."""
Edith Wharton's Italian Gardens,,Vivian Russell,,78170,,Bulfinch,192,,,,"Edith Wharton's current and richly deserved renaissance, fueled by acclaimed film adaptations of three of her novels, The Age of Innocence, The Buccaneers, and Ethan Frome, has given her work a large contemporary audience. Wharton was also a passionate gardener -- and her descriptions of Italian gardens are among the most lyrical ever written.Wharton devotees, gardeners, and Italophiles alike will delight in following Vivian Russell as she tours Italy in Wharton's footsteps. Russell combines passages from Wharton's 1904 travel book Italian Villas and Their Gardens with insights from other literary garden visitors such as Charles Dickens and Henry James, and a lavish array of 180 new color photographs by Russell that show the gardens and villas today -- plus 30 historical photographs that present them as they were in Wharton's golden age."
Novellas and Other Writings: Madame de Treymes / Ethan Frome / Summer / Old New York / The Mother’s Recompense / A Backward Glance,"[{'id': '16', 'name': 'Edith Wharton', 'role': ''}, {'id': '21450', 'name': 'Cynthia Griffin Wolff', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Edith Wharton,eng,6325,,Library of America,1137,,,,"Collected in this <em>Library of America</em> volume are no fewer than six of the works of Edith Wharton: novels, novellas, and her renowned autobiography, <em>A Backward Glance</em>. Together they represent nearly a quarter century in the productive life of one of the most accomplished and admired of American writers.<br /><br /><em>Madame de Treymes</em> (1907) is set in fashionable Paris society, where a once free-spirited American woman is trying to extricate herself, with the help of a fellow countryman, from her marriage to an aristocratic Frenchman. Wharton’s keen sense of the American-European contrast shows Paris society as stifling as life in any New England village.<br /><br />Such a village is the scene of <em>Ethan Frome</em> (1911), a tale of marital entrapment even more relentless. Ethan’s unhappy marriage and his desperate love for his wife’s cousin Mattie drive him to an act of shattering violence. The magnificent coda is a classic of American realistic fiction.<br /><br />Set in the same region of the Berkshires, Wharton called <em>Summer</em> (1917) “the Hot Ethan.” It is the story of a young woman’s initiation into the intricate sexual and social mores of a small town—and her revolt against them. The complex relationship between Lawyer Royall and his ward, Charity, is one of Wharton’s most subtle and evocative.<br /><br />Observations of the American scene continue in the four novellas that make up <em>Old New York</em> (1924). They take us from the 1840s of “False Dawn,” where a young man is ostracized for his avant garde taste in art, to the 1870s of “New Year’s Day,” where a domestic scandal unfolds. “The Spark” tells of a seemingly ordinary socialite who nevertheless was touched by his Civil War experiences. “The Old Maid,” a story of illegitimacy in which a mother refuses to claim her parental rights so her daughter might have advantages she cannot offer, is one of Wharton’s most popular.<br /><br />The poignancies of parenthood are also the theme of <em>The Mother’s Recompense</em> (1925). Kate Clephane, a divorced woman who has been living in Europe, returns to New York to find her former lover engaged to her daughter—and to face the emotional tangles of this unusual triangle. Wharton also explores here the changes that have taken place in New York since World War I.<br /><br />The fullest portraits of New York are saved for <em>A Backward Glance</em> (1934), one of the most compelling of American autobiographies. It is a fascinating record of Wharton’s literary career, of her friendships (including a loving appreciation of Henry James), as well as her thoughts on writing.<br /><br />Another perspective is offered in “Life and I,” an autobiographical fragment that shows a younger Wharton writing with great frankness about her early life. It is published here for the first time."
French Ways and Their Meaning,,Edith Wharton,,331894,,Countryman Press,176,,,,"Edith Wharton was devoted to the French people and their culture. During the First World War, while living in France and devoting herself to numerous war and relief efforts, she wrote several essays about the French and the unique attributes of their civilization, having in mind particularly the need for both Americans and the English to understand the ways of a people whose nation they were defending in the Great War. These pieces were first published in book form in 1919, under the title French Ways and Their Meaning."

Impoverished but well-born, Lily realizes a secure future depends on her acquiring a wealthy husband. Her downfall begins with a romantic indiscretion, intensifies with an accumulation of gambling debts, and climaxes in a maelstrom of social disasters.<br /><br />More a tale of social exclusion than of failed love, <i>The House of Mirth</i> reveals Wharton's compelling gifts as a storyteller and her clear-eyed observations of the savagery beneath the well-bred surface of high society. As with <i>The Age of Innocence</i> and <i>Ethan Frome</i>, this novel was also made into a successful motion picture."

The volume is divided into four sections: writings of musicians about improvising; examinations of inter- and cross-cultural dialogue; discussions of social practice and identity; and essays about collaborative dissonance. The 17 essays present jazz improvisation as a cultural practice with far-reaching ramifications. Music is treated not merely as an artistic phenomenon, but as a social force with the power to effect substantial change among people of marginalized races, genders, sexualities and ethnicities. The collection argues that there is a distinctive relationship between the emergence of free jazz, the desire for social justice and activist practices. The Other Side of Nowhere is a groundbreaking book that offers multiple perspectives on the art of jazz improvisation--it will inspire readers to create, collaborate and dissent.<br /><br />CONTRIBUTORS: John Corbett, Krin Gabbard, Michael Jarrett, George E.

"Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life, and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt",,David McCullough,eng,54350,,Simon  Schuster,445,,,,"<i>Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life, and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt</i> is the brilliant biography of the young Theodore Roosevelt. Hailed as a masterpiece by <i>Newsday,</i> it also won the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize for Biography. Now with a new introduction by the author, <i>Mornings on Horseback</i> is reprinted as a Simon &amp; Schuster Classic Edition. <p> <i>Mornings on Horseback</i> is about the world of the young Theodore Roosevelt. It is the story of a remarkable little boy, seriously handicapped by recurrent and nearly fatal attacks of asthma, and his struggle to manhood: an amazing metamorphosis seen in the context of the very uncommon household (and rarefied social world) in which he was raised. </p><p> His father is the first Theodore Roosevelt, ""Greatheart,"" a figure of unbounded energy, enormously attractive and selfless, a god in the eyes of his small, frail namesake. His mother, Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt, is a Southerner and celebrated beauty, but also considerably more, which the book makes clear as never before. There are sisters Anna and Corinne, brother Elliott (who becomes the father of Eleanor Roosevelt), and the lovely, tragic Alice Lee, Teddy Roosevelt's first love. And while such disparate figures as Abraham Lincoln, Mrs. John Jacob Astor, and Senator Roscoe Conkling play a part, it is this diverse and intensely human assemblage of Roosevelts, all brought to vivid life, which gives the book its remarkable power. </p><p> The book spans seventeen years � from 1869 when little ""Teedie"" is ten, to 1886 when, as a hardened ""real life cowboy,"" he returns from the West to pick up the pieces of a shattered life and begin anew, a grown man, whole in body and spirit. The story does for Teddy Roosevelt what Sunrise at Campobello did for FDR � reveals the inner man through his battle against dreadful odds. </p><p> Like David McCullough's <i>The Great Bridge,</i> also set in New York, this is at once an enthralling story, with all the elements of a great novel, and a penetrating character study. It is brilliant social history and a work of important scholarship, which does away with several old myths and breaks entirely new ground. For the first time, for example, Roosevelt's asthma is examined closely, drawing on information gleaned from private Roosevelt family papers and in light of present-day knowledge of the disease and its psychosomatic aspects. </p><p> At heart it is a book about life intensely lived...about family love and family loyalty...about courtship and childbirth and death, fathers and sons...about winter on the Nile in the grand manner and Harvard College...about gutter politics in washrooms and the tumultuous Republican Convention of 1884...about grizzly bears, grief and courage, and ""blessed"" mornings on horseback at Oyster Bay or beneath the limitless skies of the Badlands. ""Black care rarely sits behind a rider whose pace is fast enough,"" Roosevelt once wrote. It is the key to his life and to much that is so memorable in this magnificent book.</p>"
The Great Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge,,David McCullough,eng,437205,,,,,,,"<b>Published on the fortieth anniversary of its initial publication, this edition of the classic book contains a new Preface by David McCullough, “one of our most gifted living writers” (<i>The Washington Post</i>).</b><p>Built to join the rapidly expanding cities of New York and Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Bridge was thought by many at the start to be an impossibility destined to fail if not from insurmountable technical problems then from political corruption. (It was the heyday of Boss Tweed in New York.) </p><p> But the Brooklyn Bridge was at once the greatest engineering triumph of the age, a surpassing work of art, a proud American icon, and a story like no other in our history. Courage, chicanery, unprecedented ingenuity and plain blundering, heroes, rascals, all the best and worst in human nature played a part. At the center of the drama were the stricken chief engineer, Washington Roebling and his remarkable wife, Emily Warren Roebling, neither of whom ever gave up in the face of one heartbreaking setback after another. </p><p><i> The Great Bridge</i> is a sweeping narrative of a stupendous American achievement that rose up out of its era like a cathedral, a symbol of affirmation then and still in our time.</p>"
John Adams,,David McCullough,eng,963375,,Simon & Schuster,751,,,,"In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second president of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the most moving love stories in American history. <p> This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship, and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, <i>John Adams</i> is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.</p>"
The Johnstown Flood,,David McCullough,eng,1391380,,Peter Smith Publisher,302,,,,"At the end of the last century, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was a booming coal-and-steel town filled with hardworking families striving for a piece of the nation's burgeoning industrial prosperity. In the mountains above Johnstown, an old earth dam had been hastily rebuilt to create a lake for an exclusive summer resort patronized by the tycoons of that same industrial prosperity, among them Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Mellon. Despite repeated warnings of possible danger, nothing was done about the dam. Then came May 31, 1889, when the dam burst, sending a wall of water thundering down the mountain, smashing through Johnstown, and killing more than 2,000 people. It was a tragedy that became a national scandal. <p> Graced by David McCullough's remarkable gift for writing richly textured, sympathetic social history, <i>The Johnstown Flood</i> is an absorbing, classic portrait of life in nineteenth-century America, of overweening confidence, of energy, and of tragedy. It also offers a powerful historical lesson for our century and all times: the danger of assuming that because people are in positions of responsibility they are necessarily behaving responsibly.</p>"
"The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914",,David McCullough,eng,1025700,,Simon  Schuster,697,,,,"On December 31, 1999, after nearly a century of rule, the United States officially ceded ownership of the Panama Canal to the nation of Panama. That nation did not exist when, in the mid-19th century, Europeans first began to explore the possibilities of creating a link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow but mountainous isthmus; Panama was then a remote and overlooked part of Colombia.<br /><br />All that changed, writes David McCullough in his magisterial history of the Canal, in 1848, when prospectors struck gold in California. A wave of fortune seekers descended on Panama from Europe and the eastern United States, seeking quick passage on California-bound ships in the Pacific, and the Panama Railroad, built to serve that traffic, was soon the highest-priced stock listed on the New York Exchange. <br /><br />To build a 51-mile-long ship canal to replace that railroad seemed an easy matter to some investors. But, as McCullough notes, the construction project came to involve the efforts of thousands of workers from many nations over four decades; eventually those workers, laboring in oppressive heat in a vast malarial swamp, removed enough soil and rock to build a pyramid a mile high. In the early years, they toiled under the direction of French entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps, who went bankrupt while pursuing his dream of extending France's empire in the Americas. <br /><br />The United States then entered the picture, with President Theodore Roosevelt orchestrating the purchase of the canal—but not before helping foment a revolution that removed Panama from Colombian rule and placed it squarely in the American camp."

Now the crew of the Pequod, on a pursuit that features constant adventure and horrendous mishaps, must follow the mad Ahab into the abyss to satisfy his unslakeable thirst for vengeance. Narrated by the cunningly observant crew member Ishmael, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is the tale of the hunt for the elusive, omnipotent, and ultimately mystifying white whale—Moby Dick. <br /><br />On its surface, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is a vivid documentary of life aboard a nineteenth-century whaler, a virtual encyclopedia of whales and whaling, replete with facts, legends, and trivia that <b>Melville</b> had gleaned from personal experience and scores of sources. But as the quest for the whale becomes increasingly perilous, the tale works on allegorical levels, likening the whale to human greed, moral consequence, good, evil, and life itself. Who is good? The great white whale who, like Nature, asks nothing but to be left in peace? Or the bold Ahab who, like scientists, explorers, and philosophers, fearlessly probes the mysteries of the universe? Who is evil? The ferocious, man-killing sea monster? Or the revenge-obsessed madman who ignores his own better nature in his quest to kill the beast? <br /><br />Scorned by critics upon its publication, <i>Moby-Dick</i> was publicly derided during its author’s lifetime.

In the novel, published in 1851 after sixteen months of writing, Herman Melville recounts the Promethean quest of Captain Ahab, who, having lost a leg in a earlier battle with White Whale, is determined to catch the beast and destroy it. By the time readers meet Ahab, he is a vengeful, crazed, and terror-provoking figure, for Moby Dick has come to represent for him all the evil in the world.<br /><p>The relentless voyage of Ahab and his crew, a finely etched group of weird and wonderful characters who seem both flesh-and-blood individuals and symbolic of the varying qualities of men, becomes a masterful drama of life at sea. The drama is made more fascinating by Melville's eloquent style-a combination of the journalistic, colloquial, and poetic-and the themes and subjects he pursues-whales and whaling; mean's need for love and comradeship; and the fury of Ahab for the whale.<br /></p><p>Through realistic storytelling, symbolic allegory, and allusive and figurative language, Melville achieves in <i>Moby-dick</i>a special intensity that readers will marvel at, and not soon forget.</p>"

"Literature, Disaster, and the Enigma of Power: A Reading of 'Moby-Dick'",,Eyal Peretz,,6405,,Stanford University Press,192,,,,"This powerful new reading of <i>Moby-Dick</i> brings into play some of the most consequential theoretical developments of the last three decades in philosophy, cultural studies, and literary criticism. It takes account of four trends in innovative critical thought: recent theories of power, as articulated by Foucault, Deleuze, Butler, and Agamben; theories of trauma and testimony developed by Felman and Caruth; the new thinking of ethics, articulated by Levinas and Derrida; and the new thinking of history developed by New Historicism. All four, the author argues, participate in a groundbreaking new elaboration of the concept of disaster. <i>Moby-Dick's</i> privilege, the author claims, anticipates this new thinking of the disaster and shows that it demands simultaneously a new thinking of the literary. Read from this perspective, Melville's novel can both be illuminated by these recent theoretical developments and, in turn, illuminate them, adding new and complex dimensions to their findings.<br /><br />"

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" <br /><br /><i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.<br /><br />In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.<br /><br />Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.<br /><br />At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> will endure as a vital work of American history."

Rarely, too, are the visual and spatial aspects of these plays given careful consideration. In this detailed and innovative book, Lowell Edmunds combines two readings of the Oedipus at Colonus to arrive at a new way of looking at Greek tragedy. Edmunds sets forth a semiotic theory of theatrical space, and then applies this theory to the visual and spatial dimensions of the Oedipus at Colonus. In his historical analysis, Edmunds describes the Athenian revolution of 411 B.C.E. and its effect on Colonus. The book includes an appendix on the life of Sophocles and the reception of the Oedipus at Colonus. Edmunds' unique approach to the Oedipus at Colonus. makes this an important book for students and scholars of semiotics, Greek tragedy, and theatrical performance."

"From a Sabine Jar: Reading Horace, Odes 1.9",,Lowell Edmunds,,6429,,University of North Carolina Press,178,,,,"This book is a detailed study of a single poem -- Horace, <i>Odes 1.9 -- often called 'The Soracte Ode' after the mountain named in its second line. Although more than seventy articles and parts of books have been devoted to this twenty-four line poem since the beginning of the last century, Lowell Edmunds is the first scholar to apply developments in literary theory from outside the field of classics to a discussion of the ode. Specifically, he uses Hans Robert Jauss's essay on Baudelaire's Spleen (II) as a model for his study.<br /><br />According to Edmunds, attempts to answer aesthetic questions about ancient lyric poems typically begin with philological or historical facts -- which scholars present as new evidence, heretofore undiscovered or misunderstood -- and proceed to an analysis built on those facts. Edmunds argues that contemporary literary theory provides a different way of reconciling the aestheic and historical claims of a lyric poem, ancient or modern. He then takes a fresh look at Horace's poem, employing Jauss's method of performing three successive readings of the text: the first aesthetic or perceptual, the second interpretive, and the third historicist.<br /><br />In this hermeneutic Jaussian approach, Edmunds shows, the unity of the poem appears in the process of reading rather than, as in a philological approach, in the analysis of it. Moreover, he labels an emphasis on the act of reading itself, distinct from analysis, as the main difference between philological and hermeneutical ways of understanding a poem. Focusing on this contrast, he surveys the history of the ode's reception and scholarly interpretation. In the final chapter, he briefly considers deconstruction as an alternative critical method. Assessing the rival claims of hermeneutics, deconstruction, and philology as interpretive tools, Edmunds concludes by favoring hermeneutics.<br /><br />Originally published in 1992.<br /><br />A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

Aiding Democracy Abroad: The Learning Curve,,Thomas Carothers,,6435,,Carnegie Endowment for Int'l Peace,410,,,,"Aid to promote democracy abroad has emerged as a major growth industry in recent years. Not only the United States but many other Western countries, international institutions, and private foundations today use aid to support democratic transitions in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. Though extensive in scope, these activities remain little understood outside the realm of specialists. Debates among policymakers over democracy promotion oscillate between unhelpful poles of extreme skepticism and unrealistic boosterism, while the vast majority of citizens in aid-providing countries have little awareness of the democracy-building efforts their governments sponsor. Aiding Democracy Abroad is the first independent, comprehensive assessment of this important new field. Drawing on extensive field research and years of hands-on experience, Thomas Carothers examines democracy-aid programs relating to elections, political parties, governmental reform, rule of law, civil society, independent media, labor unions, decentralization, and other elements of what he describes as ""the democracy template"" that policymakers and aid officials apply around the world. Steering a careful path between the inflated claims of aid advocates and the exaggerated criticisms of their opponents, Carothers takes a hard look at what such programs achieve and how they can be improved."

These vignettes of country life, which center on competitions of song and love are the foundational poems of the western pastoral tradition. They were the principal model for Virgil in the Eclogues and their influence can be seen in the work of Petrarch and Milton. Although it is the pastoral poems for which he is chiefly famous, Theocritus also wrote hymns to the gods, brilliant mime depictions of everyday life, short narrative epics, epigrams, and encomia of the powerful. The great variety of his poems illustrates the rich and flourishing poetic culture of what was a golden age of Greek poetry.<br /> Based on the original Greek text, this accurate and fluent translation is the only edition of the complete Idylls currently in print. It includes an accessible introduction by Richard Hunter that describes what is known of Theocritus, the poetic tradition and Theocritus' innovations and what exactly is meant by ""bucolic"" poetry."

Taking as their departure point the annual comic competitions at the Athenian dramatic festivals, the contributors examine how the polis--as a place, a political entity, a specific social organization, and a set of ideological representations--was enacted on stage from the middle of the fifth century B.C. through the fourth. <br /><br />Applying a variety of critical approaches to Athenian comedy, these essays are grouped around three broad categories: utopianism, fissures in the social fabric, and the new polis of fourth-century comedy. The contributors explore the sociopolitical and material contexts of the works discussed and trace the genre into the fourth century, when it underwent profound changes. Simultaneously a study of classical Greek literature and an analysis of cultural production, this collection reveals how for two centuries Athens itself was transformed, staged as comedy, and, ultimately, shaped by contemporary material, social, and ideological forces. <br /><br />The contributors are Elizabeth Bobrick, Gregory Crane, Gregory Dobrov, Malcolm Heath, Jeffrey Henderson, Timothy P.

This cumbersome process inevitably created errors and made it increasingly difficult to identify the original readings among multiple copies. Lachmann's method—associated with German classicist Karl Lachmann (1793-1851)—aimed to provide scholars with a scientific, systematic procedure to standardize the transmission of ancient texts. Although these guidelines for analysis were frequently challenged, they retained a paradigmatic value in philology for many years. In 1963, Italian philologist Sebastiano Timpanaro became the first to analyze in depth the history and limits of Lachmann's widely established theory with his publication, <i>La genesi del metodo del Lachmann</i>.<br /><br />This important work, which brought Timpanaro international repute, now appears in its first English translation.<i> The Genesis of Lachmann's Method</i> examines the origin, development, and validity of Lachmann's model as well as its association with Lachmann himself. It remains a fundamental work on the history and methods of philology, and Glenn W. Most's translation makes this seminal study available to an English-speaking audience. Revealing Timpanaro's extraordinary talent as a textual critic and world-class scholar, this book will be indispensable to classicists, textual critics, biblical scholars, historians of science, and literary theorists."

Jolted out of his comfortable routine, Merton is forced to reassess his need for love and his commitment to celibacy and the monastic vocation.This astonishing volume traces Merton’s struggle to reconcile his unexpected love with his sacred vows while continuing to grapple with the burning social issues of the day – including racial conflicts, the war in Vietnam, and the Arab-Israeli conflict – visiting and corresponding with high-profile friends like Thich Nhat Hanh and Joan Baez, and further developing his writing career. Revealing Merton to be ‘very human’ in his chronicles of the ecstasy and torment of being in love, Learning to Love comes full circle as Merton recommits himself completely and more deeply to his vocation even as he recognizes ‘my need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which solitude is at once a problem and a ‘solution’.

He leisurely divested himself of his trim overcoat, folding it in exact creases and laying it gingerly across the back of his seat; stowed his traveling-bag; smoothed his hair with a masked movement of his gloved hand; pulled down a buckskin vest, opening the lower button; removed his gloves and folded them in his breast pocket, while with the same gesture a careful forefinger, unperceived, assured itself that his lilac silk necktie was in contact with the high collar whose points, painfully but in perfect style, attacked his chin. Then, settling, not flopping, down, he completed his preparations for the journey by raising the sharp crease of the trousers one inch over each knee -- a legendary precaution which in youth is believed to prevent vulgar bagging. Each movement was executed without haste or embarrassment, but leisurely, with the deliberate savoir-faire of the complete man of the world he had become at the terrific age of eighteen."

At the war’s end in September 1945, under General MacArthur’s media blackout, correspondents were forbidden to enter both Nagasaki and Hiroshima. But instead of obediently staying with the press corps in northern Japan, Weller broke away. The intrepid newspaperman reached Nagasaki just weeks after the atomic bomb hit the city. Boldly presenting himself as a U.S. colonel to the Japanese military, Weller set out to explore the devastation.<br /><br />As Nagasaki’s first outside observer, long before any American medical aid arrived, Weller witnessed the bomb’s effects and wrote “the anatomy of radiated man.” He interviewed doctors trying to cure those dying mysteriously from “Disease X.” He typed far into every night, sending his forbidden dispatches back to MacArthur’s censors, assuming their importance would make them unstoppable. He was wrong: the U.S. government censored every word, and the dispatches vanished from history.<br /><br />Weller also became the first to enter the nearby Allied POW camps. From hundreds of prisoners he gathered accounts of watching the atomic explosions bring an end to years of torture and merciless labor in Japanese mines. Their dramatic testimonies sum up one of the least-known chapters of the war—but those stories, too, were silenced.<br /><br />It is a powerful experience, more than 60 years later, to walk with Weller through the smoldering ruins of Nagasaki, or hear the sagas of prisoners who have just learned that their torment is over, and watch one of the era’s most battle-experienced reporters trying to accurately and unsentimentally convey to the American people scenes unlike anything he—or anyone else—knew. <br /><br />Weller died in 2002, believing it all lost forever. Months later, his son found a fragile copy in a crate of moldy papers. This historic body of work has never been published.<br /><br />Along with reports from the brutal POW camps, a stirring saga of the worst of the Japanese “hellships” which carried U.S. prisoners into murder and even cannibalism, and a trove of Weller’s unseen photos, <b>First into Nagasaki</b> provides a moving, unparalleled look at the bomb that killed more than 70,000 people and ended WWII. Amid current disputes over the controlled embedding of journalists in war zones and a government’s right to keep secrets, it reminds us how such courageous rogue reporting is still essential to learning the truth."

An erudite murder mystery set in a fourteenth-century monastery, it is not only a gripping story but also a brilliant exploration of medieval philosophy, history, theology, and logic.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 1327, Brother William of Baskerville is sent to investigate a wealthy Italian abbey whose monks are suspected of heresy. When his mission is overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths patterned on the book of Revelation, Brother William turns detective, following the trail of a conspiracy that brings him face-to-face with the abbey's labyrinthine secrets, the subversive effects of laughter, and the medieval Inquisition. Caught in a power struggle between the emperor he serves and the pope who rules the Church, Brother William comes to see that what is at stake is larger than any mere political dispute-that his investigation is being blocked by those who fear imagination, curiosity, and the power of ideas.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>The Name of the Rose </i>offers the reader not only an ingeniously constructed mystery--complete with secret symbols and coded manuscripts--but also an unparalleled portrait of the medieval world on the brink of profound transformation."

De Kooning: An American Master,"[{'id': '1746', 'name': 'Mark Stevens', 'role': ''}, {'id': '1745', 'name': 'Annalyn Swan', 'role': ''}]",Mark Stevens,eng,302716,,Knopf Publishing Group,732,,,,"Willem de Kooning is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century, a true “painter’s painter” whose protean work continues to inspire many artists. In the thirties and forties, along with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock, he became a key figure in the revolutionary American movement of abstract expressionism. Of all the painters in that group, he worked the longest and was the most prolific, creating powerful, startling images well into the 1980s.<br /><br />The first major biography of de Kooning captures both the life and work of this complex, romantic figure in American culture. Ten years in the making, and based on previously unseen letters and documents as well as on hundreds of interviews, this is a fresh, richly detailed, and masterful portrait. The young de Kooning overcame an unstable, impoverished, and often violent early family life to enter the Academie in Rotterdam, where he learned both classic art and guild techniques. Arriving in New York as a stowaway from Holland in 1926, he underwent a long struggle to become a painter and an American, developing a passionate friendship with his fellow immigrant Arshile Gorky, who was both a mentor and an inspiration. During the Depression, de Kooning emerged as a central figure in the bohemian world of downtown New York, surviving by doing commercial work and painting murals for the WPA. His first show at the Egan Gallery in 1948 was a revelation. Soon, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess were championing his work, and de Kooning took his place as the charismatic leader of the New York school—just as American art began to dominate the international scene.<br /><br />Dashingly handsome and treated like a movie star on the streets of downtown New York, de Kooning had a tumultuous marriage to Elaine de Kooning, herself a fascinating character of the period. At the height of his fame, he spent his days painting powerful abstractions and intense, disturbing pictures of the female figure—and his nights living on the edge, drinking, womanizing, and talking at the Cedar bar with such friends as Franz Kline and Frank O’Hara. By the 1960s, exhausted by the feverish art world, he retreated to the Springs on Long Island, where he painted an extraordinary series of lush pastorals. In the 1980s, as he slowly declined into what was almost certainly Alzheimer’s, he created a vast body of haunting and ethereal late work.<br /><br />This is an authoritative and brilliant exploration of the art, life, and world of an American master."

In Europe, however, the artist has yet to be fully recognized, particularly with regards to his work of the 1960s and 1970s, when he retreated from urban life to live and work on Long Island. This segment of de Kooning's oeuvre bears the imprint of a fundamental experience of the landscape, for it was in these Long Island works that he developed a new style of figuration, characterized by a transformed sense of color and energetic gesture. This period of vigorous, pioneering creativity is illuminated for the first time in this volume, which features a concentrated selection of large-format paintings. In images and essays by Klaus Kertess, Harold Rosenberg and others, the book illustrates how de Kooning's paintings--although recognizable as landscapes--grew abstract under the influence of his intense experience of nature."

Starting as an ""angry young man"" in the 1930s, he is best known for his Women series-a subject he pursued from the beginning to the end of his career. In the 1970s he began to make sculptures.<br />At a ripe old age, de Kooning's furor made way for a quiet, almost conceptual art of painting that is nevertheless full of suspense. Heading in a new direction, his works became more drawing-like, with a preference for primary colors, eventually including pastel colors to the palette. Bridging the gap to Minimalism, he never abandoned gestural forms.<br />This volume is the first to focus on Willem de Kooning's late paintings, with essays by Julie Sylvester and David Sylvester. It accompanies a travelling exhibition starting at the Hermitage Museum St. Petersburg in summer 2006 and presenting 24 works, most of which have never been seen before.<p></p>"

Today our shared anxiety has become far more complex and insidious, arising from tyranny, terrorism, and the invisible power of the “quasi state.” As Wole Soyinka suggests, the climate of fear that has enveloped the world was sparked long before September 11, 2001. <br /><br />Rather, it can be traced to 1989, when a passenger plane was brought down by terrorists over the Republic of Niger. From Niger to lower Manhattan to Madrid, this invisible threat has erased distinctions between citizens and soldiers; we’re all potential targets now.<br /><br />In this seminal work, Soyinka explores the implications of this climate of fear: the conflict between power and freedom, the motives behind unthinkable acts of violence, and the meaning of human dignity. Fascinating and disturbing, <i>Climate of Fear</i> is a brilliant and defining work for our age."

The Horn of the Unicorn: A Mosaic of the Life of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre,,David Allen White,,6548,,,,,,,"Dr. White has done it again! From the author of our tremendously popular The Mouth of the Lion (the life of heroic Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer) comes this new - and different - biography of Archbishop Lefebvre.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this biography is unlike ANY you have read before. It is a mosaic, if you will, providing parenthetical glimpses and historical soundbites of the life of Marcel Lefebvre. Each tid-bit (sometimes one to a page, sometimes five to a page) offers a new and fascinating insight.<br /><br />A truly unique style of writing. It is perfectly suited to those who want the convenience of picking up the book and reading for one minute OR one hour. Pick it up. Put it down. On your time.<br /><br />Although not a definitive and exhaustive biography like Bishop Tissier de Mallerais's Marcel Lefebvre, The Horn of the Unicorn deftly weaves poetry, Scripture, anecdotes, news, and history into the story of the life of Archbishop Lefebvre.<br /><br />The result is an inspiring and thought-provoking appreciation of his life from one of America's most distinguished Catholic writers. But, you're asking, ""I read Bishop Tissier's bio. Why should I read this one?"" Because it invites the reader to reflect on the life of Archbishop Lefebvre in a new and different way. Like a motion picture on paper, Dr. White associates thoughts, images, notions, quotations in such a way that an understanding of the Archbishop and his times emerges.<br /><br />The crisis in the Church is not fun. None of us wants the current situation we are in, but God has His reasons... ""to them that love God, all things work together unto good"" (Rom. 8:28). One of these reasons is summed up in the Latin phrase ""Crescit sub pondere Virtus"" (virtue grows out of adversity). We have the opportunity to ""step up to the plate"" ourselves AND the privilege of living among saints. How many of us met this great man? Were confirmed by him? Received the Body of Christ from his hands? Received his blessing? How fortunate we are!<br /><br />Dr. White says, ""But allow me to share a comment made to me once by the late Fr. Malachi Martin, 'Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer are the two great saints of the modern Church. Once this catastrophe ends they will be instantly canonized.'"""

Now, in Sun Tzu and the Art of Business, Mark R. McNeilly shows how Sun Tzu's strategic principles can be successfully applied to modern business situations. Here are really two books in one: McNeilly's synthesis of Sun Tzu's ideas into six strategic principles for the business executive, plus the entire text of Samuel B. Griffith's popular translation of The Art of War. Within, McNeilly explains how to gain market share without inciting competitive retaliation, how to attack a competitor's weak points, and how to maximize the power of market information for competitive advantage. He also demonstrates the value of speed, preparation, and secrecy in throwing the competition off-balance, employing strategy to beat the competition, and the need for character in successful leaders. In his final chapter, McNeilly presents a practical method to put Sun Tzu and The Art of Business into practice. By using modern examples throughout the book from GE, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, BMW, Southwest Airlines, FedEx, and many others, he illustrates how, by following the wisdom of history's most respected strategist, executives can avoid the pitfalls of management fads and achieve lasting competitive advantage."

Unfortunately, in the current day, this approach is pretty much horse hockey.<br /><br /><em> Sun Tzu was a Sissy</em> will transcend all those efforts and teach the reader how to make war, win, and enjoy the plunder in the real world, where those who do not kick, gouge, and grab are left behind at the table to pay the tab.

Great Expectations,,Charles Dickens,,2612809,,Dover Publications,380,,,,"In this unflaggingly suspenseful story of aspirations and moral redemption, humble, orphaned Pip, a ward of his short-tempered older sister and her husband, Joe, is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman. And, indeed, it seems as though that dream is destined to come to pass — because one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of ""great expectations."" In telling Pip's story, Dickens traces a boy's path from a hardscrabble rural life to the teeming streets of 19th-century London, unfolding a gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, and love and loss. Its compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.<br />Written in the last decade of Dickens' life, <i>Great Expectations</i> was praised widely and universally admired. It was his last great novel, and many critics believe it to be his finest. Readers and critics alike praised it for its masterful plot, which rises above the melodrama of some of his earlier works, and for its three-dimensional, psychologically realistic characters — characters much deeper and more interesting than the one-note caricatures of earlier novels. ""In none of his other works,"" wrote the reviewer in the 1861 <i>Atlantic</i>, ""does he evince a shrewder insight into real life, and a cheaper perception and knowledge of what is called <i>the world</i>."" To Swinburne, the novel was unparalleled in all of English fiction, with defects ""as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadows on a sunlit sea."" Shaw found it Dickens' ""most completely perfect book.""

O ensaio termina com um testamento claro e por vezes emocionante dos ideais cristãos."

Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the 'folly' of simple Christian piety. Erasmus's wit, wordplay and wisdom made the book an instant success, but it also attracted what may have been sales-boosting criticism. The <i>Letter to Maarten van Dorp, 1515</i>, which is a defence of his ideas and methods, is also included."

Tom uses both traditional hand carving tools and rotary tools to get the effects that make these dragons so realistic.

Collected Travel Writings: The Continent: A Little Tour in France / Italian Hours / Other Travels,"[{'id': '159', 'name': 'Henry James', 'role': ''}, {'id': '27112', 'name': 'Richard Howard', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Henry James,eng,6626,,Library of America,868,116929,Collected Travel Writings,2,"Collected in this <em>Library of America</em> volume (and its companion) is evidence that Henry James as a traveler fulfilled his own famous directive to aspiring novelists: “Try to be one of the people on whom nothing is lost!” Henry James’s travel writings are at once literary masterpieces, unsurpassed guidebooks and penetrating reflections on the international themes familiar from his fiction.<br /><br />This volume of Henry James’s incomparable travel writings begins with the classic <em>A Little Tour in France</em> (1900), illustrated with Joseph Pennell’s exquisite drawings from the original edition. James begins his tour of the French countryside one rainy morning in mid-September of 1882, when he sets off for the city of Tours as a means of exploring the proposition that “though France might be Paris, Paris was by no means France.”<br /><br />From Tours, Balzac’s birthplace, James travels to the great chateaux of the Loire Valley, visiting Chambord, Amboise, Chenonceaux, and Blois, where, as you cross the threshold, “you step straight into the sunshine and storm of the French Renaissance.” He admires the view of the quays in Nimes, which shine with “the bright greyness which is the tone of French landscape art”; in Toulouse he meditates on a history “saturated with blood and perfidy”; and in Beaune he savors an atmosphere “like the taste of a sweet russet pear.” Dense with literary associations and historical echoes, James’s prose brings castles and cathedrals and old walled towns to life. In his glancingly precise visual evocations of terrain and cityscape, he realizes his ambition “to sketch without a palette or brushes.”<br /><br />Henry James loved Italy, “a beautiful disheveled nymph” to England’s “good married matron.” The incisive and witty essays in <em>Italian Hours</em> (1909) describe memorably happy sojourns in Venice, Rome, and Florence, and excursions to Siena, Assisi, Perugia, Capri, Ravenna, and other Italian cities. “Nowhere do art and life seem so interfused” as in Venice, wrote James in celebration of the splendor of Venetian light and color, air, and history. He records his radiant impressions of Roman churches and aqueducts, museums and fountains, and rambles through the gardens of the Villa Borghese in spring, when Rome seems lighted “with an irresistible smile.” All these essays are filled with James’s intense pleasure in Italian places and people.<br /><br />This volume concludes with sixteen essays on such varied places as Switzerland, Holland, Rheims, and the Pyrénées, including a memorable account of the American volunteer ambulance corps in Europe during World War One."
The Bostonians,"[{'id': '159', 'name': 'Henry James', 'role': ''}, {'id': '62578', 'name': 'R.D.

She acquires two admirers of a very different stamp: Olive Chancellor, devotee of radical causes, and marked out for tragedy; and Basil Ransom, veteran of the Civil War, with rigid views concerning society and women's place therein. Is the lovely, lighthearted Verena made for public movements or private passions? A struggle to possess her, body and soul, develops between Olive and Basil. <br />The exploitation of Verena's unregenerate innocence reflects a society whose moral and cultural values are failing to survive the new dawn of liberalism and democracy. The Bostonians (1886) was not welcomed by James's fellow countrymen, who failed to appreciate its delicacy and wit; but a century later, this book is widely regarded as James's finest American fiction, and perhaps his comic masterpiece."
Novels 1896–1899: The Other House / The Spoils of Poynton / What Maisie Knew / The Awkward Age,"[{'id': '159', 'name': 'Henry James', 'role': ''}, {'id': '165654', 'name': 'Myra Jehlen', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Henry James,eng,6359594,,Library of America,1035,,,,"This <em>Library of America</em> volume collects four novels written by Henry James in the period immediately following his unsuccessful five-year-long attempt to establish himself as a playwright on the London stage. Hoping to convert his “infinite little loss” into “infinite little gain,” James returned to the novelistic examination of English society with a new appreciation for what he called the “divine principle of the Scenario,” “a key that, working in the same general way fits the complicated chambers of both the dramatic and the narrative lock.”<br /><br />His continued interest in dramatic form is demonstrated in <em>The Other House</em> (1896), which was derived from the scenario for a three-act play. Set in two neighboring houses and told mostly through dialogue, the novel explores the violent and tragic consequences of jealousy and frustrated passion. In <em>The Spoils of Poynton</em> (1897), one of the most tightly constructed of James’s late novels, a house and its exquisite antique furnishings and artwork become the source of a protracted struggle involving the proud and imperious Mrs. Gereth, her amiable son, Owen, his philistine fiancée, Mona Brigstock, and the sensitive Fleda Vetch, whose moral judgment is tested by her conflicting allegiances.<br /><br /><em>What Maisie Knew</em> (1897) explores with perception and sensitivity the effect upon a young girl of her parents’ bitter divorce and their subsequent remarriages. In writing the novel James chose as his point of view what he described as “the consciousness, the dim, sweet, scared, wondering, clinging perception of the child.” <em>The Awkward Age</em> (1899) examines the complicated relations among the members of a sophisticated London social circle almost entirely through dialogue as it depicts the shifting marital prospects of a young woman poised on the verge of adult life. Both of these novels insightfully explore the ambiguity of childhood “innocence” amid adult struggles over money, power, and love."

Convinced that Grace Brissenden has become younger by drawing upon her husband, Guy, the narrator seeks to discover the source of the newfound wit of Gilbert Long, previously “a fine piece of human furniture.” His perplexing and ambiguous quest, and the varying reactions it provokes from the other guests, calls into question the imaginative inquiry central to James’s art of the novel.<br /><br />James described the essential idea of <em>The Wings of the Dove</em> as “a young person conscious of a great capacity for life, but early stricken and doomed, condemned to die under short respite, while also enamoured of the world.” The heroine, a wealthy young American heiress, Milly Theale (inspired by James’s beloved cousin Minny Temple), is slowly drawn into a trap set for her by the English adventuress Kate Croy and her lover, the journalist Morton Densher. The unexpected outcome of their mercenary scheme provides the resolution to a tragic story of love and betrayal, innocence and experience that has long been acknowledged as one of James’s supreme achievements as a novelist. This volume prints the New York Edition text of <em>The Wings of the Dove</em>, and includes the illuminating preface James wrote for that edition."

Leavis considered it to be 'not only not one of his great books, but to be a bad one.'

He is quick to perceive that Chad has been not so much corrupted as refined, and over the course of the hot summer months in Paris he gradually realizes that this discovery and acceptance of Chad's unconventional new lifestyle alter his own ideals and ambitions.<br /><br />One of Henry James's three final novels, all of which have sharply divided modern critics, <i>The Ambassadors</i> is the finely drawn portrait of a man's late awakening to the importance of morality that is founded not on the dictates of convention but on its value per se."
What Maisie Knew,,Henry James,,319546,,,,,,,"After her parents' bitter divorce, young Maisie Farange finds herself turned into a 'little feathered shuttlecock' to be swatted back and forth by her selfish mother, Ida, and her vain father, Beale, who value her only as a means of provoking one another. And when both take lovers and remarry, Maisie-solitary, observant and wise beyond her years- is drawn into an entangled adult world of intrigue and sexual betrayal, until she is finally compelled to choose her own future. Published in 1897 when Henry James was becoming increasingly experimental with narrative technique and fascinated by the idea of the child's-eye view, <i>What Maisie Knew</i> is a subtle, intricate yet devastating portrayal of an innocent adrift in a corrupt society."

His omniscient eye took in the surfaces of cities, the nuances of speech, dress, and manner, and, above all, the microscopic interactions, hesitancies, betrayals, and self-betrayals that are the true substance of relationships. The entirely new <i>Portable Henry James</i> provides an unparalleled range of this great body of work: seven major tales, including <i>Daisy Miller, The Turn of the Screw</i>, ""The Beast in the Jungle,"" and ""The Jolly Corner""; a sampling of revisions James made to some of his most famous work; travel writing; literary criticism; correspondences; autobiography; descriptions of the major novels; and parodies by famous contemporaries, including T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, and Graham Greene."

Here are courtships and legacies; the worlds of literature, theatre, and the popular press; the paradoxes of temperament and the constraints of custom; the clash of conscience and desire. Stylistically, the stories allowed James to experiment with tones and devices quite different from his novels—dramatic plot twists and surprise endings, swift pacing and ebullient humor. The brilliance of his technical command allowed him to transform the tiniest of suggestions—a fleetingly observed gesture, an anecdote dropped at a dinner party—into fiction remarkable for its lambent surfaces and intricate psychological counterpoint.<br /><br />The twenty-one stories in this volume represent James at the peak of his storytelling powers. Among them are “The Turn of the Screw,” one of his most popular works, and a terrifying exercise in psychological horror centering on the corruption of childhood innocence; “The Real Thing,” a playful consideration of the illusion of art and the paradoxes of authenticity; “The Figure in the Carpet,” “The Death of the Lion,” and “The Middle Years,” three very different expositions of the mysteries of authorship, embodying some of James’s most profound insights into the nature of his own art; “The Altar of the Dead,” a somber, ultimately wrenching meditation on the relation of the living to the dead; and “In the Cage,” an extended evocation of the inner life of a young woman trapped in a dehumanizing job at a postal-and-telegraph office."

Here Colm Tóibín, the author of the Man Booker Prize shortlisted novel <i>The Master</i>, a portrait of Henry James, brings together for the first time all the stories that James set in New York City. Written over the course of James's career and ranging from the deliciously tart comedy of the early ""An International Episode"" to the surreal and haunted corridors of ""The Jolly Corner,"" and including ""Washington Square"", the poignant novella considered by many (though not, as it happens, by the author himself) to be one of James's finest achievements, the nine fictions gathered here reflect James's varied talents and interests as well as the deep and abiding preoccupations of his imagination. And throughout the book, as Tóibín's fascinating introduction demonstrates, we see James struggling to make sense of a city in whose rapidly changing outlines he discerned both much that he remembered and held dear as well as everything about America and its future that he dreaded most.<br /><br />Stories included:<br />The Story of a Masterpiece<br />A Most Extraordinary Case<br />Crawford's Consistency<br />An International Episode<br />The Impressions of a Cousin<br />The Jolly Corner<br />Washington Square<br />Crapy Cornelia<br />A Round of Visits"

To pass the long journey they told each other stories of magic and trickery, of animals with blazing eyes, of people with pants on fire, of love and death and the devil. Geraldine McCaughrean retells The Canterbury Tales for children in a lively and humorous style that captures the original flair of Chaucer himself. She introduces us to the characters who told these tales: the shy, battle-hardened Knight, the Summoner whose breath smells of onions, the Widow of Bath who likes a happy ending. The stories and characters are brought to life by the brush of Victor Ambrus, with pictures of wild chases, exciting battles, and the English countryside."

Rich with humorous insights into the many foibles of humanity, this poem is considered by most literary critics and scholars to be the first great example of literary art written in vernacular English. Its narrative opens as a party of 30 men and women from various walks of life gather at the Tabard Inn in London, from where they set out on a holy pilgrimage to Canterbury and its shrine dedicated to Thomas Ã Becket. As they travel, each person has a story to tell. <br /><br /> The most famous and beloved of Chaucer’s stories are presented in interlinear form this intensely readable volume. Alternating each of Chaucer’s original lines with its translation into modern English, this book encourages readers to savor the genius of Chaucer’s original poetry while following each line with an easy-to-understand modern translation of his Southeast Midlands dialect of Middle English. This scholarly yet truly approachable translation of Chaucer’s original poem is the work of Vincent F. Hopper, a longtime professor of English literature at New York University. He opens with the famous Prologue— <br /><br /> Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote <br /><i> When April with his showers sweet </i><br /> The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote, <br /><i> The drought of March has pierced to the root </i><br /><br /> —and then goes on to present <br />The Miller’s Tale The Reeve’s Tale The Prioress’s Tale The Nun’s Priest’s Tale The Pardoner’s Tale The Wife of Bath’s Tale The Franklin’s Tale . . . and more. <br /> This fine volume also includes an enlightening introductory essay on Chaucer’s art, with Professor Hopper’s commentary on England as it existed in the fourteenth century.

He executed public murals, designed fabrics and stage sets, was an inventive collagist and printmaker, and turned his magic touch to the fields of painting, sculpture, advertising, and even wartime propaganda. This is the first comprehensive look at Steinberg’s extraordinary contribution to 20th-century art, which was that of a modern-day illuminator, putting word and image in play to create art that spoke to the eyes, and minds, of readers.<br />An introduction by poet Charles Simic tracks the origins of Steinberg’s darkly comic sensibility in the “Balkan bazaar” of his native Romania. Joel Smith shows how architectural training and an early rise to fame as a cartoonist in Fascist-era Milan honed the artist’s gift for subtle graphic invention, and explores why one of the most visible, prolific, potent, and cosmopolitan careers in postwar American art has so thoroughly evaded serious study. Tracing the evolving motives that underlie Steinberg’s multi-layered activity, this handsome volume also raises fundamental questions about the historiography of modernism and the vexed status of “the middlebrow avant-garde” in an age of museum-bound art.<br />Previously unseen sketches, documents, and printed matter from the artist’s papers illustrate the essay, career chronology, and entries for 120 objects featured in this important book."
Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution,,Howard Rheingold,,6661,,Basic Books,288,,,,"From Tokyo to Helsinki, Manhattan to Manila, Howard Rheingold takes us on a journey around the world for a preview of the next techno-cultural shift-a shift he predicts will be as dramatic as the widespread adoption of the PC in the 1980s and the Internet in the 1990s. The coming wave, says Rheingold, is the result of super-efficient mobile communications-cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and wireless-paging and Internet-access devices that will allow us to connect with anyone, anywhere, anytime. From the amusing (""Lovegetty"" devices in Japan that light up when a person with the right date-potential characteristics appears in the vicinity) to the extraordinary (the overthrow of a repressive regime in the Philippines by political activists who mobilized by forwarding text messages via cell phones), Rheingold gives examples of the fundamentally new ways in which people are already engaging in group or collective action. He also considers the dark side of this phenomenon, such as the coordination of terrorist cells, threats to privacy, and the ability to incite violent behavior. Applying insights from sociology, artificial intelligence, engineering, and anthropology, Rheingold offers a penetrating perspective on the brave new convergence of pop culture, cutting-edge technology, and social activism. At the same time, he reminds us that, as with other technological revolutions, the real impact of mobile communications will come not from the technology itself but from how people use it, resist it, adapt to it, and ultimately use it to transform themselves, their communities, and their institutions."

Besides being the abbess of a large and influential Benedictine abbey, she was a prominent preacher, healer, scientist, and artist. She also was a composer and theologian, writing nine books on theology, medicine, science, and physiology, as well as 70 poems and an opera. At the age of 42, she began to have visions; these were captured as 36 illuminations--24 of which are recorded in this book along with her commentaries on them. She also wrote a text describing these visions entitled <i>Scivias</i> (Know the Ways), now published as <i>Hildegard of Bingen's Mystical Visions</i>. <br /><br />Author Matthew Fox has stated, ""If Hildegard had been a man, she would be well known as one of the greatest artists and intellectuals the world has ever seen."" It is a credit to the power of the women's movement and our times that this towering genius of Western thought is being rediscovered in her full grandeur and autonomy. <br /><br />Virtually unknown for more than 800 years in Western history, Hildegard was featured as one of the women in Judy Chicago's <i>Dinner Party</i> in the early 1980s and published for the first time in English by Bear &amp; Company in 1982.

He places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database.<br /><br />Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media."

Graphic Design: A History,,Alain Weill,,6700,,Harry N. Abrams,160,,,,"Rooted in the decorative arts movements of late 19th-century and early 20th-century Britain and continental Europe, and furthered by progress in printing technology, the graphic arts answered industry's call to communicate to the masses in an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace. Over the last hundred years, commercial graphic design has evolved into increasingly sophisticated strategies in brand identity, repetition, and conceptual advertising. The graphic arts have also emerged from the purely commercial sphere into both political and artistic realms, furthering the reach and uses of this unique art form. Heavily illustrated with archival images, illustrations, and photographs, and with an informative text by graphic arts expert Alain Weill, this book will be the perfect introduction to the societal, artistic, and political uses of graphic design over the last century."

For the revised edition, a new final chapter covers all the recent international developments in graphic design, including the role of the computer and the Internet in design innovation and globalization. In the last years of the twentieth century, at a time when ""designer products"" and the use of logos grew in importance, the role of graphic designers became more complex, subversive, and sometimes more political—witness Oliviero Toscani's notorious advertisements for Benetton. Digital technology cleared the way for an astonishing proliferation of new typefaces, and words began to take second place to typography in a whole range of magazines and books as designers asserted the primacy of their medium. Designers and companies discussed here include Neville Brody, David Carson, Design Writing Research, Edward Fella, Tibor Kalman, Jeffery Keedy, LettError, Pierre di Sciullo, Tomato, Gerard Unger, Cornel Windlin, and a host of others."

Immigrant Acts: On Asian American Cultural Politics,,Lisa Lowe,eng,6704,,Duke University Press Books,272,,,,"In <i>Immigrant Acts</i>, Lisa Lowe argues that understanding Asian immigration to the United States is fundamental to understanding the racialized economic and political foundations of the nation. Lowe discusses the contradictions whereby Asians have been included in the workplaces and markets of the U.S. nation-state, yet, through exclusion laws and bars from citizenship, have been distanced from the terrain of national culture.<br /><br />Lowe argues that a national memory haunts the conception of Asian American, persisting beyond the repeal of individual laws and sustained by U.S. wars in Asia, in which the Asian is seen as the perpetual immigrant, as the “foreigner-within.” In <i>Immigrant Acts</i>, she argues that rather than attesting to the absorption of cultural difference into the universality of the national political sphere, the Asian immigrant—at odds with the cultural, racial, and linguistic forms of the nation—displaces the temporality of assimilation. Distance from the American national culture constitutes Asian American culture as an alternative site that produces cultural forms materially and aesthetically in contradiction with the institutions of citizenship and national identity. Rather than a sign of a “failed” integration of Asians into the American cultural sphere, this critique preserves and opens up different possibilities for political practice and coalition across racial and national borders.<br /><br />In this uniquely interdisciplinary study, Lowe examines the historical, political, cultural, and aesthetic meanings of immigration in relation to Asian Americans. Extending the range of Asian American critique, <i>Immigrant Acts </i>will interest readers concerned with race and ethnicity in the United States, American cultures, immigration, and transnationalism."

We have all admired the natural grace of old buildings and wondered why modern architects seem to have such a hard time creating their equal. We live in a time when only a few gifted and dedicated teams of designers can produce buildings that approach the beauty of these that eighteenth-century carpenters created all by themselves. What went wrong? In this fascinating tour of our buildings and our social history, Jonathan Hale examines the historical moment in the 1830s when builders and architects began to lose their sense of surety about what they were doing. He explores the societal pressures that turned buildings from pure efforts at expression into structures laden with symbols. Most important, he uncovers - in terms the lay reader can easily understand - the principles that animate great architecture, no matter what its style or period. In The"

Invisible Relations: Representations of Female Intimacy in the Age of Enlightenment,,Elizabeth Susan Wahl,,6723,,Stanford University Press,376,,,,"This book explores the ambivalent and often contradictory ways in which English and French writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries represented relations of intimacy between women. These representations included both a sexualized model of the “lesbian” tribade and an “idealized” model that portrayed female friendship as devoid of sexual expression. Although these two perceptions of female intimacy may seem mutually exclusive, the author argues that both operate as defining parameters, not only for literary representations of relations between women but also for cultural responses to those institutions in which women could gather—salon, convent, theater, or brothel.<br /><br />Despite increasing evidence of female homosocial and homosexual bonds during this period, representations of female intimacy have remained largely invisible within critical discourse. They are overshadowed either by a dominant heterosexual understanding of such institutions as marriage or prostitution or by historical patterns of male homosexual behavior, to which they often do not correspond. By broadening the concept of intimacy to include relations between women that may evade or subvert the boundaries of “compulsory” heterosexuality, the author argues, one can locate a duality of “polite” and eroticized models of female intimacy in the cultural discourses of both France and England.<br /><br />Analyzing a variety of legal, medical, and historical materials, as well as literary texts—by Aphra Behn, Katherine Philips, Madeleine de Scudéry, Catherine Descartes, Delarivier Manley, and John Cleland—the author outlines a combination of cultural and historical circumstances that contributed to or were symptomatic of increasing consciousness and concern about female homosexuality in England and France. Relating this sexualized model of female intimacy to idealized images of female friendship in mainstream literary texts allows the author to recover an incipient discourse of female homosexuality. She also delineates cultural fantasies about the outcome of unregulated contact between women, as well as underlying fears that such intimacy could foster aberrant social and political behavior in addition to unauthorized sexual relations between women.<br /><br />"
E=mc²: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation,,David Bodanis,eng,2352922,,Berkley Trade,337,,,,"E=mc². Just about everyone has at least heard of Albert Einstein's formulation of 1905, which came into the world as something of an afterthought. But far fewer can explain his insightful linkage of energy to mass. David Bodanis offers an easily grasped gloss on the equation. Mass, he writes, ""is simply the ultimate type of condensed or concentrated energy,"" whereas energy ""is what billows out as an alternate form of mass under the right circumstances.""<p> Just what those circumstances are occupies much of Bodanis's book, which pays homage to Einstein and, just as important, to predecessors such as Maxwell, Faraday, and Lavoisier, who are not as well known as Einstein today. Balancing writerly energy and scholarly weight, Bodanis offers a primer in modern physics and cosmology, explaining that the universe today is an expression of mass that will, in some vastly distant future, one day slide back to the energy side of the equation, replacing the ""dominion of matter"" with ""a great stillness""--a vision that is at once lovely and profoundly frightening.</p><p> Without sliding into easy psychobiography, Bodanis explores other circumstances as well; namely, Einstein's background and character, which combined with a sterling intelligence to afford him an idiosyncratic view of the way things work--a view that would change the world. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"

Here too is Alan Turing, whose dream of a marvelous thinking machine—what we know as the computer—was met with indifference, and who ended his life in despair after British authorities forced him to undergo experimental treatments to “cure” his homosexuality. <br /><br />From the frigid waters of the Atlantic to the streets of Hamburg during a World War II firestorm to the interior of the human body, <i>Electric Universe</i> is a mesmerizing journey of discovery by a master science writer."
Passionate Minds,,David Bodanis,en-US,6725,,Crown Publishing Group (NY),373,,,,"It was 1733 when the poet and philosopher Voltaire met Emilie du Châtelet, a beguiling—and married—aristocrat who would one day popularize Newton’s arcane ideas and pave the way for Einstein’s theories. In an era when women were rarely permitted any serious schooling, this twenty-seven-year-old’s nimble conversation and unusual brilliance led Voltaire, then in his late thirties, to wonder, “Why did you only reach me so late?” They fell immediately and passionately in love.<br /><br />Through the prism of their tumultuous fifteen-year relationship we see the crumbling of an ancient social order and the birth of the Enlightenment. Together the two lovers rebuilt a dilapidated and isolated rural chateau at Cirey where they conducted scientific experiments, entertained many of the leading thinkers of the burgeoning scientific revolution, and developed radical ideas about the monarchy, the nature of free will, the subordination of women, and the separation of church and state. <br /><br />But their time together was filled with far more than reading and intellectual conversation. There were frantic gallopings across France, sword fights in front of besieged German fortresses, and a deadly burning of Voltaire’s books by the public executioner at the base of the grand stairwell of the Palais de Justice in Paris. The pair survived court intrigues at Versailles, narrow escapes from agents of the king, a covert mission to the idyllic lakeside retreat of Frederick the Great of Prussia, forays to the royal gambling tables (where Emilie put her mathematical acumen to lucrative use), and intense affairs that bent but did not break their bond.<br /><br />Along with its riveting portrait of Voltaire as a vulnerable romantic, Passionate Minds at last does justice to the supremely unconventional life and remarkable achievements of Emilie du Châtelet—including her work on the science of fire and the nature of light. Long overlooked, her story tells us much about women’s lives at the time of the Enlightenment. Equally important, it demonstrates how this graceful, quick-witted, and attractive woman worked out the concepts that would lead directly to the “squared” part of Einstein’s revolutionary equation: E=mc2.<br /><br />Based on a rich array of personal letters, as well as writings from houseguests, neighbors, scientists, and even police reports, <b>Passionate Minds</b> is both panoramic and intimate in feeling. It is an unforgettable love story and a vivid rendering of the birth of modern ideas."

In ""The Secret Garden,"" David Bodanis takes us on an eye-opening journey through this mysterious domain where plants and insects engage daily in a Darwinian epic of survival.<br /><br />Ants navigate through a forest of grass blades, forming networks that act as a living ""computer"" to gather intelligence from the world above. Caterpillars attack a shrub, which in turn sends up a chemical signal to call for help from a passing wasp. Roots from different plants battle one another underground with sophisticated chemical weapons, releasing poisonous gases into the soil. A tiny triungulin, the juvenile form of a common beetle, launches itself from a geranium leaf to latch on to a passing bee. An oak tree registers where a beetle is biting into its bark and targets the damaged quadrant with dangerous poisons, while other trees puff out warning vapors when they're under attack by insects. Through it all wander a couple who are oblivious to the activity taking place around them and unaware of the effect their very presence has on the garden's environment.<br /><br />As in his wonderful previous book, ""The Secret House,"" David Bodanis once again guides us through the terrain of the familiar yet unseen world around us and brilliantly transforms it. Written with the same witty style that the Washington Post called ""marvelously captivating"" and illustrated throughout with state-of-the-art microphotographs, ""The Secret Garden"" is an astonishing book that will fascinate and delight anyone who has ever set foot in a garden.'<br /><br />(description from the book flap)"

It began life as a slapstick comedy about Siamese twins, but as he wrote, something deepened. ""The tale kept spreading along, and spreading along, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more time with their talk and their affairs. It changed from a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it,"" Twain wrote in his frank afternote to the novel. In the end, the voice that comes to dominate the tale is Roxana's, a light-skinned slave who switches her infant son with her master's son to keep him from being sold down the river. Roxana, Twain's most complex and fully-realized adult female character, is a compelling and memorable tragic heroine, trapped with her son by the brutal system of slavery and by their own inescapable racial identities.

When Griet becomes a maid in the household of the painter Johannes Vermeer, she thinks she knows her role: housework, laundry, and the care of his six children. She even feels able to handle his shrewd mother-in-law; his restless, sensual wife; and their jealous servant. What no one expects is that Griet's quiet manner, quick perceptions, and fascination with her master's paintings will draw her inexorably into his world. Their growing intimacy sparks whispers; and when Vermeer paints her wearing his wife's pearl earrings, the gossip escalates into a full-blown scandal that irrevocably changes Griet's life.<br /><br />Written with the precision and focus of an Old Master painting, <b>Girl With a Pearl Earring</b> is a vivid portrait of colorful seventeenth-century Delft, as well as the hauntingly poignant story of one young girl's rite of passage."

Falling Angels,,Tracy Chevalier,eng,2220311,,,,,,,"In <i>Falling Angels</i>, Tracy Chevalier has combined a moving elegy to the lost innocence of the 21st century's grandmothers and great-grandmothers with a reminder of the strength and modernity of their aspirations and achievements. Maude and Livy are aged six in 1901, when Queen Victoria has just died and the whole country is in mourning. In 1910 they are almost young women who have experienced their own personal losses and belong to a generation who are no longer prepared to wear black for months to mark the death of Edward VII. Their families, the Colemans and the Waterhouses (""no relation to the painter""), meet in a graveyard beside their family graves. One has a large marble angel erected above it, the other an urn (an allusion more to the morbidity of a Victorian columbarium than the eternity of Keats' pre-Victorian ""unravish'd bride of quietness""). Their choices of a monument to death seem to reflect their differing attitudes to life, but Chevalier makes clear that these two families are forever linked in their fates and aspirations. <p> The story moves swiftly, switching to multiple narratives: young but quickly maturing Maude and Livy; the adult Colemans and Waterhouses; their servants; and Simon the gravedigger boy. Chevalier has chosen carefully who speaks when, and who, more importantly, keeps silent. Livy's little sister Ivy May is one of the most beguiling figures of the work, but is given only two sentences of her own (and those two bring a lump to the throat). Mrs Coleman's experiences with the campaign for women's suffrage are marginalised through silence; Maude and Livy tell instead of their reaction to the women's antics. And while <i>Falling Angels</i> may be a story of women, despite, or perhaps because of their exclusion from contemporary politics, Simon's observations are the most honest and revealing. </p><p> Chevalier herself writes after the story's end that ""the Acknowledgements is the only section of a novel that reveals an author's ""normal"" voice. Every character uses their ""normal"" voice in this novel, and Chevalier's own voice excels in ensuring that each one is unique (for example, everything is ""delicious"" for Livy), so that, like Mr Coleman mourning his daughter growing up, you will ""miss her when she goes"". --<i>Olivia Dickinson</i></p>"

Drawing on countless nights in dozens of blues clubs throughout Chicago, David Grazian shows how this quest for authenticity has transformed the very shape of the blues experience. He explores the ways in which professional and amateur musicians, club owners, and city boosters define authenticity and dish it out to tourists and bar regulars. He also tracks the changing relations between race and the blues over the past several decades, including the increasing frustrations of black musicians forced to slog through the same set of overplayed blues standards for mainly white audiences night after night. In the end, Grazian finds that authenticity lies in the eye of the beholder: a nocturnal fantasy to some, an essential way of life to others, and a frustrating burden to the rest. <br /><br />""Chicago has given the world distinctive forms of urban blues and urban sociology. . . .

In his journal he chronicles his daily battle to stay alive, as he conquers isolation, fashions shelter and clothes, first encounters another human being and fights off cannibals and mutineers.

The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,,Daniel Defoe,,604666,,,,169255,Robinson Crusoe,1,"<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is a novel by Daniel Defoe, first published on 25 April 1719. The first edition credited the work's protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents.<br /><br />Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is presented as an autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer), a castaway who spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers, before ultimately being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called ""Más a Tierra"", now part of Chile, which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966.<br /><br />Despite its simple narrative style, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre.

For Defoe, bankrupt and just released from prison for seditious writings, the storm struck during one of his bleakest moments. <br />But it also furnished him with the material for his first book, and in his powerful depiction of private suffering and individual survival played out against a backdrop of public calamity we can trace the outlines of his later masterpieces such as A Journal of the Plague Year and Robinson Crusoe."

Narrated by Huck himself in his artless vernacular, it tells of his voyage down the Mississippi with a runaway slave named Jim. As the two journey downstream on a raft, Huck's vivid descriptions capture the sights, smells, sounds, and rhythms of life on the great river. As they encounter traveling actors, con men, lynch mobs, thieves, and Southern gentility, his shrewd comments reveal the dark side of human nature. By the end of the story, Huck has learned about the dignity and worth of human life-and Twain has exposed the moral blindness of the ""respectable"" slave-holding society in which he lives. Huckleberry Finn was Twain's greatest creation. Garrison Keillor approaches it with the respect and affection it deserves. ""This is an abridgement of Mark Twain's book, keeping the parts I loved as a boy-Huck's story, the big river at night, the boasting of the raftsmen, the Duke and the Dauphin, the lynching, the feud-and lopping off the last third of the book, where Tom Sawyer comes in and makes a big production of freeing Jim. I had Huck free him instead. If you enjoy the reading, I am sure Mr. Twain will forgive me."" -Garrison Keillor"

What has come to be known as the Matter of Hannibal inspired two of his most famous books, <i>Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, and provided the basis for the eleven pieces reprinted here. Most of these selections (eight of them fiction and three of them autobiographical) were never completed, and all were left unpublished. Written between 1868 and 1902, they include a diverse assortment of adventures, satires, and reminiscences in which the characters of his own childhood and of his best-loved fiction, particularly Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, come alive again. The autobiographical recollections culminate in an astounding feat of memory titled ""Villagers of 1840-3"" in which the author, writing for himself alone at the age of sixty-one, recalls with humor and pathos the characters of some one hundred and fifty people from his childhood. Accompanied by notes that reflect extensive new research on Mark Twain's early life in Missouri, the selections in this volume offer a revealing view of Mark Twain's varied and repeated attempts to give literary expression to the Matter of Hannibal.<br /><br />Texts established by Dahlia Armon, Paul Baender, Walter Blair, William M.

Budd', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Mark Twain,eng,6855,,Library of America,1050,,,,"This <em>Library of America</em> book, with its companion volume, is the most comprehensive collection ever published of Mark Twain’s short writings — the incomparable stories, sketches, burlesques, hoaxes, tall tales, speeches, satires, and maxims of America’s greatest humorist. Arranged chronologically and containing many pieces restored to the form in which Twain intended them to appear, the volumes show with unprecedented clarity the literary evolution of Mark Twain over six decades of his career.<br /><br />This volume contains eighty pieces from the years 1891 to 1910, when Twain emerged from bankruptcy and personal tragedy to become the white-suited, cigar-smoking international celebrity who reported on his own follies and those of humanity with an unerring sense of the absurd. Some stories display Twain’s fascination with money and greed, such as “The Esquimau Maiden’s Romance” and “The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg.” Other stories, written after the death of his daughter Susy in 1896, explore the outer limits of fantasy and psychic phenomena, including “Which Was the Dream?” “The Great Dark,” and “My Platonic Sweetheart.”<br /><br />The United States military involvement in Cuba, China, and the Philippines turned Twain’s attention to political satire and invective. “To the Person Sitting in Darkness,” “The United States of Lyncherdom,” “The Czar’s Soliloquy,” and “The War Prayer” are biting denunciations of European and American imperialism. Other political issues inspired articles and stories about the Jews, the notorious Dreyfus case, and vivisection. Twain’s increasingly unorthodox religious opinions are powerfully, often comically, expressed in “Extracts from Adam’s Diary,” “Eve’s Diary,” “Eve Speaks,” “Adam’s Soliloquy,” “A Humane Word from Satan,” “What is Man?” “Extract from Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven,” and “Letters from the Earth.”<br /><br />“Against the assault of laughter,” he said, “nothing can stand.” Twain’s brilliant inventiveness continues to shine in such later comic masterpieces as “Fenimore Cooper’s Literary Offences,” “Italian Without a Master,” “Hunting the Deceitful Turkey,” and “My First Lie and How I Got Out of It.” A posthumous collection of proverbs and aphorisms (“More Maxims of Mark”) is included as an appendix.<br /><br />The publishing history of every story, sketch, and speech in this volume has been thoroughly researched, and in each instance the most authoritative text has been reproduced. This collection also includes an extensive chronology of Twain’s complex life, helpful notes on the people and events referred to in his works, and a guide to the texts."

The Secret Garden,,Frances Hodgson Burnett,eng,3186437,,Children's Classics,331,,,,"""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. <br /> <br />The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. <br /> <br />The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. <br /> <br />The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

My Secret Garden,,Nancy Friday,,176578,,,,,,,"This book caused quite a ruckus when it was released 25 years ago because it directly quotes the sexual fantasies of dozens of women, ranging from the ""very common"" rape fantasy to lesbian affairs to unusually explicit scenarios that are unmentionable here. While author Nancy Friday maintains that <i>My Secret Garden</i> served to free millions of women from sexual oppression, there's still a need today to get rid of the guilt that millions more still feel when it comes to fantasizing, having orgasms, and making one's sexual wishes be known. ""How could it be, you might ask,"" she writes, ""that women today, at the turn of the century, would still think they were the only Bad Girls with erotic thoughts? What kind of prison is this that that women impose on themselves?"" <p> <i>My Secret Garden</i> has the prurient appeal that made it one of the most passed-around books in high school study halls (it boasts chapters titled ""Insatiability"" and ""The Thrill of the Forbidden""), but its premise, underneath the tales of lusty longings, is a serious one. Friday, also author of <i>My Mother, My Self</i> and <i>Women on Top</i>, is appalled at how parents, especially mothers, instill in their children a deep fear of sexual pleasure, and she advises how to do away with this stultifying force. While Friday can get a little histrionic at times (""Women's lust ... could bring down not only individuals, but society itself""), that doesn't make this book any less enthralling. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>"

Frances Hodgson Burnett: The Unexpected Life of the Author of the Secret Garden,,Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina,,6878,,Rutgers University Press,384,,,,"Hugely successful in her own time for adult novels and plays, Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) would be astounded to find out she is remembered for a handful of books for children, but most of all for the enormously popular Secret Garden. This fascinating biography-the first to have the full cooperation of Burnett's descendants and relatives-examines her life with lively intelligence, sensitivity, and fascinating new, never-before-published material.<br /><br />Burnett's life was full of those reversals of fortune that mark her work. Following modest beginnings in mid-Victorian Manchester, she arrived in post-Civil War Tennessee at the age of fifteen with her widowed mother and two sisters. Burnett was the breadwinner of the family from the age of seventeen, eventually publishing a total of fifty-two books and writing and producing thirteen plays. She made and spent a fortune in her lifetime, was generous and profligate, yet anxious about money and obsessively hardworking.<br /><br />Constantly restless and inventive, Burnett's personal life was as complex as her professional one. Her first marriage to a southern doctor disintegrated as a result of her notorious flirtations and a scandalous affair, and her subsequent marriage to an English doctor turned actor suffered a similar fate. She understood the intensity and loneliness of the thoughtful child, but was herself a largely absent mother of two sons-overwhelmed by guilt when tragedy struck one of them; the other one never got over being the model for Little Lord Fauntleroy.<br /><br />A woman of contrasts and paradoxes, this quintessentially British writer was equally at home in the United States, which honored her with a memorial in Central Park. Frances Hodgson Burnett reinvented for herself and for generations to come in both countries the magic and the mystery of the childhood she never had."

In the Garden: Essays in Honor of Frances Hodgson Burnett,,Angelica Shirley Carpenter,,6881,,Scarecrow Press,261,,,,"Frances Hodgson Burnett, author of The Secret Garden, A Little Princess, and Little Lord Fauntleroy, was one of the most successful and controversial women of her time. Burnett's flamboyant persona and unconventional lifestyle made her a contentious figure in Victorian society, and for generations after her death, her own family refused to acknowledge her. Burnett is best known for her children's literature, but she began her career as a bestselling adult novelist. The themes of Burnett's adult novels were often serious: working women, abusive marriages, and single motherhood, and for many years these novels have been overshadowed by the fame of her children's books. Recently, however, scholars have rediscovered these works and have begun to study and write about them. In 2003 at California State University, Fresno, Angelica Carpenter convened the first conference ever held about this famous author. Scholars, fans, and collectors gathered to contribute to the knowledge on the author and to discuss her accomplishments. The talks ranged from scholarly to conversational, covering Burnett's books for both children and adults, the plays and movies that were made from them, the books they inspired, and the way in which the author's life was reflected in her fiction. In the Garden: Essays in Honor of Frances Hodgson Burnett recreates many of the conference talks, as well as other essays offering practical advice for collectors and the first interview ever published with Burnett's great-granddaughter, who inherited the family archive."

It also delights in good food and a robust appetite, and the health and strength they can bring. Written at a time when many children were going hungry and even starving, Burnett's beloved story celebrates the magic of fresh air, new milk, homemade currant buns, and hearty, simple fare. Inside the pages of this cookbook are recipes for Mary's favorite foods, in and out of the garden, from porridge to roasted potatoes and eggs, all inspired by The Secret Garden and all adapted by chef and culinary historian Amy Cotler from traditional Victorian recipes. Ms. Cotler has supplemented these simple, wholesome recipes with fascinating tidbits on Victorian foods and Victorian eating customs. The result is a scrumptious tribute to Burnett's classic novel, a fascinating glimpse into the cooking customs of a historical period that is now long past, and a step-by-step guide to making delicious, tasty treats to enjoy in your own secret garden."
Privileged Son: Otis Chandler And The Rise And Fall Of The L.A. Times Dynasty,,Dennis McDougal,,6887,,Da Capo Press,528,,,,"Here is the riveting story of how a second-rate newspaper rose to national greatness, only to become a casualty of war-a civil war within the family that owned it. Told in a hard-edged, investigative style, it spans the American Century, from 1884, when the Chandler family gained control of the just-born daily, through April 2000, when they sold it to the Tribune Company. Above all, Privileged Son chronicles the life of Otis Chandler, the Times' chief architect after 1960, whose flamboyant exploits in and out of the publisher's suite changed the perspective of the newspaper, and Los Angeles, forever.Using scores of insider sources, Dennis McDougal, the best-selling author of The Last Mogul, will surprise readers with his findings, including accounts of political graft and early mob connections among one of L.A.'s most prominent families. The Chandlers, who helped establish the national careers of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and several other major political figures, controlled Los Angeles and the Times Mirror Corporation with a capriciousness that is seldom seen, even in the most dysfunctional media dynasties.Privileged Son is a thoroughly compelling page-burner that will keep readers engaged from its opening paragraphs. But it is also a numbing morality tale that extends far beyond Otis Chandler to highlight the greed that brought down one of America's richest family dynasties and one of its most prominent newspapers."

Economics in One Lesson: The Shortest & Surest Way to Understand Basic Economics,,Henry Hazlitt,,6894,,Three Rivers Press,218,,,,"A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt’s <i>Economics in One Lesson</i> is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.<br /><br />Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of <i>The Freeman</i> magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote <i>Economics in One Lesson</i>, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.<br /><br />Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of <i>Economics in One Lesson</i>. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make <i>Economics in One Lesson</i>, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication."

On Classical Economics,,Thomas Sowell,,6905,,Yale University Press,320,,,,"Thomas Sowell's many writings on the history of economic thought have appeared in a number of scholarly journals and books, and these writings have been praised, reprinted, and translated in various countries around the world.<br /><br />The classical era in the history of economics is an important part of the history of ideas in general, and its implications reach beyond the bounds of the economics profession.  <i>On Classical Economics</i> is a book from which students can learn both history and economics. It is not simply a Cook's tour of colorful personalities of the past but a study of how certain economic concepts and tools of analysis arose, and how their implications were revealed during the controversies that followed. In addition to a general understanding of classical macroeconomics and microeconomics, this book offers special insight into the neglected pioneering work of Sismondi—and why it was neglected—and a detailed look at John Stuart Mill's enigmatic role in the development of economics and the mysteries of Marxian economics.<br /><br />Clear, engaging, and very readable, without being either cute or condescending, <i>On Classical Economics</i> can enable a course on the history of economic thought to make a contribution to students’ understanding of economics in general--whether in price theory, monetary theory, or international trade.  In short, it is a book about analysis as well as history."
Black Rednecks and White Liberals,,Thomas Sowell,eng,1323864,,Encounter Books,372,,,,"This book presents the kind of eye-opening insights into the history and culture of race for which Sowell has become famous. As late as the 1940s and 1950s, he argues, poor Southern rednecks were regarded by Northern employers and law enforcement officials as lazy, lawless, and sexually immoral. This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity. In addition to Black Rednecks and White Liberals, the book takes on subjects ranging from Are Jews Generic? to The Real History of Slavery."
Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One,,Thomas Sowell,eng,2622054,,Basic Books,256,,,,"The application of economics to major contemporary real world problems--housing, medical care, discrimination, the economic development of nations--is the theme of this new book that tackles these and other issues head on in plain language, as distinguished from the usual jargon of economists. It examines economic policies not simply in terms of their immediate effects but also in terms of their later repercussions, which are often very different and longer lasting. The interplay of politics with economics is another theme of <i>Applied Economics</i>, whose examples are drawn from experiences around the world, showing how similar incentives and constraints tend to produce similar outcomes among very disparate peoples and cultures."
Knowledge And Decisions,,Thomas Sowell,eng,6908,First BasicBooks Edition,Basic Books,422,,,,"This reissue of Thomas Sowell's classic study of decision making, which includes a preface by the author, updates his seminal work in the context of The Vision of the Anointed. Sowell, one of America's most celebrated public intellectuals, describes in concrete detail how knowledge is shared and disseminated throughout modern society. He warns that society suffers from an ever-widening gap between firsthand knowledge and decision making--a gap that threatens not only our economic and political efficiency but our very freedom. This is because actual knowledge is being replaced by assumptions based on an abstract and elitist social vision of what ought to be. Knowledge and Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a landmark work and selected for this prize ""because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government."" In announcing the award, the center acclaimed that the ""contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [this] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant."""
Is Reality Optional?: And Other Essays,,Thomas Sowell,,6909,,Hoover Press,192,,,,"Sowell challenges all the assumptions of contemporary liberalism on issues ranging from the economy to race to education in this collection of controversial essays, and captures his thoughts on politics, race, and common sense with a section at the end for thought-provoking quotes."

Thomas Sowell sees what has happened not as a series of isolated mistakes but as a logical consequence of a vision whose defects have led to disasters in education, crime, family disintegration, and other social pathology. In this book, ""politically correct"" theory is repeatedly confronted with facts -- and sharp contradictions between the two are explained in terms of a whole set of self-congratulatory assumptions held by political and intellectual elites. These elites -- the anointed -- often consider themselves ""thinking people,"" but much of what they call thinking turns out, on examination, to be rhetorical assertion, followed by evasions of mounting evidence against those assertions.<br /><br />"

A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles,,Thomas Sowell,eng,6913,,Basic Books,304,,,,"Controversies in politics arise from many sources, but the conflicts that endure for generations or centuries show a remarkably consistent pattern. In this classic work, Thomas Sowell analyzes this pattern. He describes the two competing visions that shape our debates about the nature of reason, justice, equality, and power: the ""constrained"" vision, which sees human nature as unchanging and selfish, and the ""unconstrained"" vision, in which human nature is malleable and perfectible. A Conflict of Visions offers a convincing case that ethical and policy disputes circle around the disparity between both outlooks."

This rabbi's son -- a ""marginal error"" -- finds himself shipwrecked with an experimental chimpanzee capable of speech, to whom he gives the name Buz.

The sole tenant in a rundown tenement, Henry Lesser is struggling to finish a novel, but his solitary pursuit of the sublime grows complicated when Willie Spearmint, a black writer ambivalent toward Jews, moves into the building. Henry and Willie are artistic rivals and unwilling neighbors, and their uneasy peace is disturbed by the presence of Willie's white girlfriend Irene and the landlord Levenspiel's attempts to evict both men and demolish the building. This novel's conflict, current then, is perennial now; it reveals the slippery nature of the human condition, and the human capacity for violence and undoing."

Rooms with a View: The Stages of Community in the Modern Theater,,Richard Lewis Barr,,6952,,University of Michigan Press,240,,,,"In Sam Shepard's play Action a character asks, ""What's a community?"" only to find that no one really knows. Rooms with a View attempts to chart the development of communal concepts through the discourse of dramatic modernism, defining a coherent pattern that illustrates and anticipates innovations in modern and postmodern social theory. To clarify the commonplace notion that audiences actively participate in dramatic art, the intro-ductory chapter theorizes a <i>performance community</i>, which audience, actors, and other backstage actants (such as playwrights and directors) provisionally form in the theater. Connecting psychological, sociological, and aesthetic insights ranging from Freud to Kohut, from Simmel to Nancy, and from Artaud and Brecht to Arnheim and Jellicoe, Richard Barr shows how modernist thinkers are repeatedly drawn to the ideal of communion. The distinctive structure of this collective inquiry helps untangle the roots and routes of modern drama and social thought.<br /><br />Barr analyzes the social and aesthetic theory of four in-fluential dramatists. Ibsen and Strindberg, he claims, explore ways of acknowledging the integrity of individual viewpoints while maintaining collective coherence. Pirandello and, in more radical ways, Beckett, conclude that conflict and division are not simply inevitable but invaluable in organizing alternative perspectives. By analyzing the ways playwrights variously conceive and achieve the complicated unity called community, <i>Rooms with a View</i> produces the rich paradox that difference may make the most difference in creative communal consensus.<br /><br />Richard L. Barr holds a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, and has taught English at Rutgers University. He is currently a specialist in intersubjective relations, practicing in New Jersey and Switzerland.<br />"

Forster; his masterpiece, <em>A Passage to India</em>, belongs with perhaps three or four other works in English at the pinnacle of literary craftsmanship in this century. Yet for many years Forster’s genius was virtually unrecognized in America. Not until 1943, when Lionel Trilling’s authoritative and discerning study was first published, did Forster find his way to a broad American audience. In this 1964 revision of the first paperbook edition, Mr. Trilling added a preface and brought the bibliography up to date. His book performs two services: it is a critical-biographical introduction to the master novelist and his works; it is in itself a primary document in the development of, contemporary American criticism. Here is criticism functioning at its best, deftly, surely, wittily, within a framework of the ideas which are basic to literary thought today."

The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,,Michael Pollan,eng,3287769,US / CAN Edition,The Penguin Press,450,,,,"What should we have for dinner? For omnivore's like ourselves, this simple question has always posed a dilemma: When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.<br /><br />The Omnivore's Dilemma is a groundbreaking book in which one of America's most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but, according to Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of The Botany of Desire, how we answer it today, ath the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic? Or perhaps something we hunt, gather or grow ourselves?<br /><br />To find out, Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us—industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves—from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.<br /><br />The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even mortal implications for all of us. Ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and Pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued, The Omnivore's Dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. For anyone who reads it, dinner will never again look, or taste, quite the same."
Assassination Vacation,,Sarah Vowell,eng,824686,,Simon  Schuster,258,,,,"Sarah Vowell exposes the glorious conundrums of American history and culture with wit, probity, and an irreverent sense of humor. With <i>Assassination Vacation,</i> she takes us on a road trip like no other—a journey to the pit stops of American political murder and through the myriad ways they have been used for fun and profit, for political and cultural advantage.<br /><br />From Buffalo to Alaska, Washington to the Dry Tortugas, Vowell visits locations immortalized and influenced by the spilling of politically important blood, reporting as she goes with her trademark blend of wisecracking humor, remarkable honesty, and thought-provoking criticism. We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogue—it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture, including literature, architecture, sculpture, and—the author's favorite— historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party, there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins, including mummies, show tunes, mean-spirited totem poles, and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult."

Gordon captures the sharp scent of feelings as they shift, the shape of particular lives in their hope and incomprehensibility. <br /><br />In The Neighborhood, a seven-year-old who has lost her father finds birthday parties, with their noisy games and spun-sugar roses on fancy cakes, her greatest trial. City Life explores the dark side of Manhattan apartment living. Intertextuality proposes a dream meeting between Proust's characters and the author's aging grandmother. Throughout, Gordon's surprising path to the center of a story is as much a part of the tale as the self-understanding her characters achieve in the process: What were they all, any of them, feeling?one narrator ventures. This was the sort of question no one in my family would ask. Feelings were for others: the weak, the idle. We were people who got on with things.<br /> <br />With their powerful insights into how we make do, both socially and privately, these stories are a treasure of American fiction. Each is a joy to read and a chance to savor Gordon's clear vision: her ability to reveal at every turn what we need and what we wish for, and her willingness, always, to address what comes of such precious wishes."

And in Crito we have a dialogue between Crito and Socrates in Socrates' prison cell prior to his execution where Crito tells Socrates that he has made arrangements to smuggle Socrates into exile and tries to convince Socrates to escape.

In fact, the familiar versions of the stories attributed to this enigmatic and astute storyteller are based on adaptations of Aesop by the liberated Roman slave Phaedrus. In turn, Phaedrus's renderings have been rewritten so extensively over the centuries that they do not do justice to the originals. In <i>Aesop's Human Zoo</i>, legendary Cambridge classicist John Henderson puts together a surprising set of up-front translations—fifty sharp, raw, and sometimes bawdy, fables by Phaedrus into the tersest colloquial English verse.<br /><br />Providing unusual insights into the heart of Roman culture, these clever poems open up odd avenues of ancient lore and life as they explore social types and physical aspects of the body, regularly mocking the limitations of human nature and offering vulgar or promiscuous interpretations of the stuff of social life.<br /><br />Featuring folksy proverbs and satirical anecdotes, filled with saucy naughtiness and awful puns, <i>Aesop's Human Zoo</i> will amuse you with its eccentricities and hit home with its shrewdly candid and red raw messages. The entertainment offered in this volume of impeccably accurate translations is truly a novelty—a good-hearted and knowing laugh courtesy of classical poetry. Beginning to advanced classicists and Latin scholars will appreciate the original Latin text provided in this bilingual edition. The splash of classic Thomas Bewick wood engravings to accompany the fables renders the collection complete."

He reveals how the seemingly disparate themes of rhetoric, justice, and the philosophic life are woven together into a coherent whole. Stauffer's interpretation of the Gorgias sheds new light on Plato's thought, indicating that Plato and Socrates had a more favorable view of rhetoric than is supposed, and challenges some of Socrates' most famous claims about justice."

Protagoras/Philebus/Gorgias,"[{'id': '879', 'name': 'Plato', 'role': ''}, {'id': '13395658', 'name': 'Benjamin Jowett', 'role': 'Translator'}]",Plato,,7049,,Prometheus Books,208,,,,Three of Plato's most important dialogues are brought together to address vital concerns that continue to occupy serious minds today: In the Protagoras Plato attempts to answer questions about the nature of virtue and whether it is inherent to humans or a subject capable of being taught. In the Philebus he addresses the nature and content of the good and whether wisdom or pleasure is to be preferred. In the Gorgias Plato customarily applies what is learned from the previous discussions to address larger issues such as the proper functioning of society and the state and the individual's appropriate place in them.
Teacher of Holiness: The Holy Spirit in Origen's Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans,,Maureen Beyer Moser,,7050,,Gorgias Press,248,,,,"Origen's Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans illustrates the centrality of the Holy Spirit for his theological project. As both God's exitus into the world and humanity's reditus to God, the Spirit forms the crucial link between Origen's doctrine of God and his spiritual anthropology. Origen's images for the Holy Spirit, understood in the context of second century concepts of ""spirit,"" convey the intersection of theology and anthropology in his thought. His picture of the Holy Spirit as the Teacher of the saints, in particular, draws from Origen's own pedagogical experience a way of expressing both the Spirit's patient love for humanity and the active human involvement in the Spirit's work in the world. This book explores Origen's understanding of the multiplicity of spirits found in the Scriptures, with particular emphasis on the Holy Spirit, the loftiest of all spirit-beings, who emerges as the unique pedagogical center of Origen's Spirit-School. As such, the Spirit is pivotal to God's outreach into the world, necessarily involved in the human soul of Jesus Christ and in that of every human being healed by Jesus. Interpreted through the scriptural language of Cherub, Ring, and Teacher, the Holy Spirit is the sign both of God's love and of human love and the mutual edification of the Christian community. Origen's pneumatology serves as an inspiration for theologians today, who seek to integrate the Spirit fully into their work, rather than just paying lip-service to the Spirit's Person and action."

The discussion of the dating of the dialogues is enormously useful; there has previously been no brief account of these issues to which one could refer the student.

This is true both in the area of philosophy and in that of literary criticism.”—Anthony C.

The Phoenician Solar Theology: An Investigation Into the Phoenician Opinion of the Sun Found in Julian's Hymn to King Helios,,Joseph Azize,,7059,,Gorgias Press,348,,,,"This is the first examination of the fragments of the solar theology of the Phoenicians. Beginning from the Emperor Julian's fourth-century statement that in the opinion of the Phoenicians 'the sunlight which is sent forth everywhere is the immaculate action of pure mind itself, ' this book contends that there existed an authentic and ancient Phoenician solar theology, similar to that described by Julian, reaching back to the sixth or fifth century BCE. Such a theology is described in Damaskios' quotation from Mochos, the Sidonian philosopher. A passage from Philo of Byblos, preserved in John Lydus, and referring to ""the noetic light,"" strengthens this argument. Phoenician funerary inscriptions are examined, together with relevant artistic evidence and some surviving accounts of Phoenician thought. Altogether, a portrait of Phoenician spiritual thought emerges: a native tradition not dependent upon Hellenic thought, but related to other Semitic cultures of the ancient Near East, and, of course, to Egypt. Many themes and motifs from ancient Phoenician religion are discussed, such as the phoenix bird (the ""Phoenician"" bird) which was associated with the concept of immortality, and the possibility that there was a Phoenician cult of ""Yhwh."" The book abstracts seven ideas from the extant material as axial concepts. In light of this analysis, it can be seen that Phoenician religion possessed a unique organizing power, in which the sun, the sun god, life, death, and humanity, were linked in a profound system, which seems to have been common amongst the Phoenician city states."

Bishop Lists: Formation of Apostolic Succession of Bishops in Ecclesiastical Crises,,Robert Lee Williams,,7065,,Gorgias Press,288,,,,"The five appearances of bishop lists in the early church mark the principal points at which apostolic succession of bishops emerged and developed into a crucial and well defined doctrine. Walter Bauer long ago termed these lists, legitimately if not charitably, oliterary propaganda.o This study delves into the political struggles surrounding the lists and the doctrine they served to define. The ancient Mediterranean world established legitimacy of authority in social institutions, whether Roman, Greek, Jewish, or Christian, by citing successions of leaders. In early catholic churches, apostolic succession was the linchpin in the three opillarso of tradition, succession, and canon. It guaranteed the first and assured interpretation of the third. A social history approach reveals political intrigue at every point of the development of the doctrine of apostolic succession. In crises of the first century, the New Testament recorded (monepiscopal?) bishops and succession, and Ignatius and 1 Clement make monepiscopacy and apostolic succession explicit. In the second and third centuries, writers employed episcopal successions in reaction to subsequent struggles with heresy and schism. By the fourth century, Eusebius employed succession lists for apologetic and edification. Ecclesiastical politics in each case reflects the threat to the bishopAEs authority and clarifies the meaning of apostolic succession in the ChurchAEs development. This social history approach, examining the function of the literature within its historical circumstances, reveals how theology developed from politics. The development is as gripping politically as it is illuminating theologically. Robert Lee Williams is Professor of Biblical Theology at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He has written a number of articles focused on New Testament and patristic topics from the vantage point of social-scientific methodology. Accordingly, Williams has been active in the SBL Social World of Early Christianity, the North American Patristics Society, the International Conference on Patristic Studies, and the Seminar on the Development of Early Catholic Christianity, and the American Society of Church History. Bishop Lists: Formation of Apostolic Succession of Bishops in Ecclesiastical Crises is a revision of his doctoral dissertation in New Testament and Early Christian Literature completed under Robert M. Grant at the University of Chicago."""

Blessed Is He Who Has Brought Adam from Sheol,,Thomas Buchan,,7067,,Gorgias Press,412,,,,"""Blessed is He who has brought Adam from Sheol"" Christ's descent to the dead in the Theology of Saint Ephrem the Syrian is an examination of the theological use of the doctrine of Christ's descent to the dead in the works of Saint Ephrem the Syrian (ca. 306-373 C.E.). In the ancient Christian church, it was believed, taught, and confessed that in the interval between his crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus Christ descended to the abode of the dead. Christ's descent to the underworld was nowhere earlier, more elaborately, or more influentially expressed than within cultural milieu of Syriac Christianity, where the underworld was designated not as Hades or Inferos, but as Sheol, and it was nowhere within this milieu more frequently, effectively, and influentially implemented than in the writings of Ephrem the Syrian. Organically integrated with and providing an integrating function within his theological reflection as a whole, Ephrem's conception of Christ's descent to Sheol provides us with an important and distinctive vision of the significance of this salvific event. Ephrem's use Semitic and non-Western poetic forms and structures as a mode of theological discourse, coupled with his preference for imagery and symbolism rather than definition, resulted in a variety of vivid depictions of Christ's descent to Sheol. Especially informed by Ephrem's view of the redemptive and revelatory significance of Christ's incarnation, these 'verbal icons' imaginatively collapsed distinctions between temporality and eternity and creatively drew together cosmological, incarnational, soteriological, ecclesiological, sacramental, and eschatological themes in the context of Christian worship. Thomas Buchan is an editor for Gorgias Press in Piscataway, New Jersey and adjunct professor of Church History at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey (Fall 2004). Born in Rahway, New Jersey in 1972, he earned a B.A. in Biblical Studies at Wheaton College (Wheaton, Illinois) and an M.A. in Church History at the Wheaton Graduate School (Wheaton, Illinois). Dr. Buchan studied the history and theology of early Christianity at the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies at Drew University, earning the M.Phil. in 1999 and completing the Ph.D. ""with distinction"" in 2003."

  <div>A classic novel from the bestselling author of <i>Moloka'i</i> and <i>Honolulu<br /><br /></i>Before Alan Brennert became a bestselling author of historical novels, he wrote this lyrical fantasy in the vein of <i>The Time Traveler’s Wife. </i>Part love story, part deeply affecting character study, it is a literary tour de force chronicling the parallel lives of two men who were once the same man--until, as the poet Robert Frost wrote, “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood/And sorry I could not travel both/And be one traveler...”<br /><br />Thirteen years ago, Richard Cochrane left his small New England town to pursue his dreams of an acting career. But on some other level of reality there is also a Rick Cochrane, who chose instead to set aside his dreams, marry the woman he loved, and raise a family. Today, neither man is happy with the choice he made--but as their lives, once separated by time and chance, now draw closer together, Richard and Rick are offered another a last chance to discover “the road not taken.”<br /><br /><i>Time and Chance </i>displays the same vivid sense of time and place--and the vibrant, memorable characters drawn with compassion, warmth, and humor--that have made the author’s historical novels national bestsellers and reading group favorites.</div>

Teaching with the Brain in Mind,,Eric Jensen,eng,7124,Second Edition,Association for Supervision & Curriculum Development,186,,,,"When the first edition of <i>Teaching with the Brain in Mind</i> was published in 1998, it quickly became an ASCD best-seller, and it has gone on to inspire thousands of educators to apply brain research in their classroom teaching. Now, author Eric Jensen is back with a completely revised and updated edition of his classic work, featuring new research and practical strategies to enhance student comprehension and improve student achievement.<br /><br />In easy to understand, engaging language, Jensen provides a basic orientation to the brain and its various systems and explains how they affect learning. After discussing what parents and educators can do to get children's brains in good shape for school, Jensen goes on to explore topics such as motivation, critical thinking skills, optimal educational environments, emotions, and memory. He offers fascinating insights on a number of specific issues, including<br /><br /><br />* How to tap into the brain's natural reward system.<br />* The value of feedback.<br />* The importance of prior knowledge and mental models.<br />* The vital link between movement and cognition.<br />* Why stress impedes learning.<br />* How social interaction affects the brain.<br />* How to boost students' ability to encode, maintain, and retrieve learning.<br />* Ways to connect brain research to curriculum, assessment, and staff development.<br /><br />Jensen's repeated message to educators is simple: You have far more influence on students' brains than you realize . . . and you have an obligation to take advantage of the incredible revelations that science is providing. The revised and updated edition of <i>Teaching with the Brain in Mind</i> helps you do just that."
"Minds, Brains and Science",,John Rogers Searle,,7126,,Harvard University Press,112,,,,"<em>Minds, Brains and Science</em> takes up just the problems that perplex people, and it does what good philosophy always does: it dispels the illusion caused by the specious collision of truths. How do we reconcile common sense and science? John Searle argues vigorously that the truths of common sense and the truths of science are both right and that the only question is how to fit them together.<br /><br />Searle explains how we can reconcile an intuitive view of ourselves as conscious, free, rational agents with a universe that science tells us consists of mindless physical particles. He briskly and lucidly sets out his arguments against the familiar positions in the philosophy of mind, and details the consequences of his ideas for the mind-body problem, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, questions of action and free will, and the philosophy of the social sciences."

Arts with the Brain in Mind,,Eric Jensen,,7129,,ASCD,182,,,,"How do the arts stack up as a major discipline? What is their effect on the brain, learning, and human development? How might schools best implement and assess an arts program? Eric Jensen answers these questions and more in this book.<br /><br />To push for higher standards of learning, many policymakers are eliminating arts programs. To Jensen, that's a mistake.<br /><br />This book presents the definitive case, based on what we know about the brain and learning, for making arts a core part of the basic curriculum and thoughtfully integrating them into every subject. Separate chapters address musical, visual, and kinesthetic arts in ways that reveal their influence on learning.<br /><br />What are the effects of a fully implemented arts program? The evidence points to the following:<br /><br />* Fewer dropouts<br />* Higher attendance<br />* Better team players <br />* An increased love of learning<br />* Greater student dignity<br />* Enhanced creativity<br />* A more prepared citizen for the workplace of tomorrow<br />* Greater cultural awareness as a bonusTo Jensen, it's not a matter of choosing, say, the musical arts over the kinesthetic. Rather, ask what kind of art makes sense for what purposes. How much time per day? At what ages? What kind of music? What kind of movement? Should the arts be required? How do we assess arts programs? In answering these real-world questions, Jensen provides dozens of practical, detailed suggestions for incorporating the arts into every classroom."

Kurlansky also brings into focus just why nonviolence is a “dangerous” idea, and asks such provocative questions as: Is there such a thing as a “just war”? Could nonviolence have worked against even the most evil regimes in history?<br /><br />Kurlansky draws from history twenty-five provocative lessons on the subject that we can use to effect change today. He shows how, time and again, violence is used to suppress nonviolence and its practitioners – Gandhi and Martin Luther King, for example; that the stated deterrence value of standing national armies and huge weapons arsenals is, at best, negligible; and, encouragingly, that much of the hard work necessary to begin a movement to end war is already complete. It simply needs to be embraced and accelerated.<br /><br />Engaging, scholarly, and brilliantly reasoned, 'Nonviolence' is a work that compels readers to look at history in an entirely new way. This is not just a manifesto for our times but a trailblazing book whose time has come."

His father, Harry, is plotting with the 1960s boogaloo star Chow Mein Vega for the comeback of this dance craze. Meanwhile, a homicidal drug addict is terrorizing the neighborhood.<br />With its cast of unforgettable characters, Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue is a comedy of cultures, of the old and the new.

Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World,,Mark Kurlansky,eng,62987,,Penguin Group,294,,,,"<b>An unexpected, energetic look at world history on sea and land from the bestselling author of <i>Salt</i> and <i>The Basque History of the World </i></b><br /><br /><br /><br />Cod, Mark Kurlansky's third work of nonfiction and winner of the 1999 James Beard Award<b>, </b> is the biography of a single species of fish, but it may as well be a world history with this humble fish as its recurring main character. Cod, it turns out, is the reason Europeans set sail across the Atlantic, and it is the only reason they could. What did the Vikings eat in icy Greenland and on the five expeditions to America recorded in the Icelandic sagas? Cod, frozen and dried in the frosty air, then broken into pieces and eaten like hardtack. What was the staple of the medieval diet? Cod again, sold salted by the Basques, an enigmatic people with a mysterious, unlimited supply of cod. As we make our way through the centuries of cod history, we also find a delicious legacy of recipes, and the tragic story of environmental failure, of depleted fishing stocks where once their numbers were legendary. In this lovely, thoughtful history, Mark Kurlansky ponders the question: Is the fish that changed the world forever changed by the world's folly?<br /><br />""Every once in a while a writer of particular skill takes a fresh, seemingly improbable idea and turns out a book of pure delight. Such is the case of Mark Kurlansky and the codfish."" -David McCullough, author of <i>The Wright Brothers </i>and <i>1776</i>"

Yet it was also the year of the Martin Luther King, Jr., and Bobby Kennedy assassinations; the riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago; Prague Spring; the antiwar movement and the Tet Offensive; Black Power; the generation gap; avant-garde theater; the upsurge of the women's movement; and the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union.<br /><br />In this monumental book, Mark Kurlansky brings to teeming life the cultural and political history of that pivotal year, when television's influence on global events first became apparent, and spontaneous uprisings occurred simultaneously around the world. Encompassing the diverse realms of youth and music, politics and war, economics and the media, 1968 shows how twelve volatile months transformed who we were as a people–and led us to where we are today."

Paris and Antwerp have recently emerged as important new centers of Jewish culture. Small but proud Jewish communities are revitalizing the ancient centers of Budapest, Prague, and Amsterdam. These brave, determined Jewish men and women have chosen to settle–or remain–in Europe after the devastation of the Holocaust, but they have paid a price. Among the unexpected dangers, they have had to cope with an alarming resurgence of Nazism in Europe, the spread of Arab terrorism, and the impact of the Jewish state on European life.<br /><br />Delving into the intimate stories of European Jews from all walks of life, Kurlansky weaves together a vivid tapestry of individuals sustaining their traditions, and flourishing, in the shadow of history. An inspiring story of a tenacious people who have rebuilt their lives in the face of incomprehensible horror, <i>A Chosen Few </i>is a testament to cultural survival and a celebration of the deep bonds that endure between Jews and European civilization.<br /><br /><b>“Consistently absorbing . . . <i>A Chosen Few</i> investigates the relatively uncharted territory of an encouraging phenomenon.”<br /><i>–Los Angeles Times </i><br /></b><br /><b>“I can think of no book that portrays with such intelligence, historical understanding, and journalistic flair what life has been like for Jews determined to build lives in Europe.”<br />–SUSAN MIRON<br /><i>Forward<br /></i></b>"

No one has ever been able to determine their origins, and even the Basques' language, Euskera—the most ancient in Europe—is related to none other on earth. For centuries, their influence has been felt in nearly every realm, from religion to sports to commerce. Even today, the Basques are enjoying what may be the most important cultural renaissance in their long existence.<br /><br />Mark Kurlansky's passion for the Basque people and his exuberant eye for detail shine throughout this fascinating book. Like <i>Cod</i>, <i>The Basque History of the World</i>,blends human stories with economic, political, literary, and culinary history into a rich and heroic tale.<br /><br />Among the Basques' greatest accomplishments:<br /><br /><br />Exploration—the first man to circumnavigate the globe, Juan Sebastian de Elcano, was a Basque and the Basques were the second Europeans, after the Vikings, in North America Gastronomy and agriculture—they were the first Europeans to eat corn and chili peppers and cultivate tobacco, and were among the first to use chocolate Religion—Ignatius Loyola, a Basque, founded the Jesuit religious order Business and politics—they introduced capitalism and modern commercial banking to southern Europe Recreation—they invented beach resorts, jai alai, and racing regattas, and were the first Europeans to play sports with balls<br />“A delectable portrait of an uncanny, indomitable nation.” –Newsday<br /><br />“Exciting, Illuminating, and thought provoking.” –The Boston Globe<br /><br />""Entertaining and instructive… [Kurlansky’s] approach is unorthodox, mixing history with anecdotes, poems with recipes.” –The New York Times Book Review"

And who is coming to celebrate its arrival but Ulysses S. Grant, 18th President of the U.S. and former commander of the Union armies. Like other residents in the Colorado boomtown this summer of 1880, Inez Stannert regards the news as mixed.

As 1879 draws to a close, this Rocky Mountain boomtown has infected the world with silver fever. It's not much different than the dot.com mania or the corporate scams that heat up over a century later. Unfortunately for Joe Rose, a precious-metals assayer, death stakes its own claim. Joe's body is found trampled into the muck behind Inez Stannert's saloon. Inez already had much more to deal with than pouring shots of Taos Lightning and cleaning up a corpse. A lady educated on the East Coast, she has a past that doesn't bear close scrutiny, including her elopement with a gambling man who has recently disappeared. Most townsfolk, including Inez's business partner, Abe Jackson, dismiss Joe's death as an accident. Death, after all, is no stranger in Leadville. But Inez wonders: Why was this loving husband and father carrying a brass token good for ""one free screw"" at the parlor house of Denver madam Mattie Silks? When Joe's widow Emma asks Inez to settle Joe's affairs, almost against her will, Inez uncovers skewed assays, bogus greenbacks, and blackmail. Lies and secrets run deep in Colorado, secrets more likely to lead to a hanging than to today's congressional hearings or country-club prisons for the crooked and the greedy.

Reading Families,,Rebecca Krug,,7193,,Cornell University Press,256,,,,"Rebecca Krug argues that in the later Middle Ages, people defined themselves in terms of family relationships but increasingly saw their social circumstances as being connected to the written word. Complex family dynamics and social configurations motivated women to engage in text-based activities. Although not all or even the majority of women could read and write, it became natural for women to think of writing as a part of everyday life.Reading Families looks at the literate practice of two individual women, Margaret Paston and Margaret Beaufort, and of two communities in which women were central, the Norwich Lollards and the Bridgettines at Syon Abbey. The book begins with Paston's letters, which were written at her husband's request, and ends with devotional texts that describe the spiritual daughterhood of the Bridgettine readers.Scholars often assume that medieval women's participation in literate culture constituted a rejection of patriarchal authority. Krug maintains, however, that for most women learning to engage with the written word served as a practical response to social changes and was not necessarily a revolutionary act."

Eleanor Rigby,,Douglas Coupland,eng,2780244,,HarperPerennial,336,,,,"Liz Dunn is one of the world’s lonely people. She’s in her late thirties and has a boring cubicle job at a communications company, doing work that is only slightly more bearable than the time she spends alone in her depressingly sterile box of a condo. Her whole life, she’s tried to get to the root of her sadness, to figure out what she’s been doing wrong, with little success. But then, one night in 1997, everything changes: while standing in the parking lot of a video store, arms full of sappy movies she’s rented to help her convalesce from oral surgery, she witnesses the passing of the Hale-Bopp comet. For Liz, this streak of light across the sky is a portent of radical change — and for her, radical change means finally accepting her lot: “I realized that my life, while technically adequate, had become all it was ever going to be … No more trying to control everything — it was now time to go with the flow.” In that moment, and for the first time, Liz feels truly free.<br /><br />A day after Liz makes the decision to seek peace in her life rather than control, along comes another comet, in the form of a stranger admitted to the local hospital with her name and number inscribed on his MedicAlert bracelet. For the new Liz, the phone call from the hospital feels like “the fulfillment of a prophecy”; the young man, it turns out, is her son, whom she gave up for adoption when she was sixteen. Jeremy shows the scars of his years as a foster child and his most recent drug reaction, but is otherwise beautiful and charming. And when he moves in with Liz to recuperate, it’s as if both of them had been waiting for this moment all their lives.<br /><br />A lost soul and occasional visionary, Jeremy upends Liz’s quiet existence — shocking her coworkers and family, redecorating her condo, getting her to reevaluate her past and take an active role in her future. But he’s also very ill with multiple sclerosis. Her son’s life-and-death battle induces a spiritual awakening in Liz — then triggers a chain of events that take her to the other side of the world and back, endangering her life just as an unexpected second chance at happiness finally seems within reach."
Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture,,Douglas Coupland,eng,2851520,,Abacus,211,,,,"Andy, Dag and Claire have been handed a society priced beyond their means. Twentysomethings, brought up with divorce, Watergate and Three Mile Island, and scarred by the 80s fall-out of yuppies, recession, crack and Ronald Reagan, they represent the new generation - Generation X.<br />Fiercely suspicious of being lumped together as an advertiser's target market, they have quit dreary careers and cut themselves adrift in the California desert. Unsure of their futures, they immerse themselves in a regime of heavy drinking and working at no-future McJobs in the service industry.<br />Underemployed, overeducated, intensely private and unpredictable, they have nowhere to direct their anger, no one to assuage their fears, and no culture to replace their anomie. So they tell stories; disturbingly funny tales that reveal their barricaded inner world. A world populated with dead TV shows, 'Elvis moments' and semi-disposable Swedish furniture...<br /><br />"

Against the Technicolor unreality of Florida's finest tourist attractions, the Drummonds stumble into every illicit activity under the tropical sun-kidnapping, blackmail, gunplay, and black market negotiations, to name a few.

He tells not only the characters' stories but also the story of our times--thalidomide, AIDS, born-again Christianity, drugs, divorce, the Internet-all bound together with the familiar glue of family love and madness.<br /></div>"

The Senator and the Socialite: The True Story of America's First Black Dynasty,,Lawrence Otis Graham,eng,7211,,Harper,480,,,,"This is the true story of America's first black dynasty. The years after the Civil War represented an astonishing moment of opportunity for African-Americans. The rush to build a racially democratic society from the ruins of slavery is never more evident than in the personal history of Blanche Kelso Bruce and his heirs.<br /><br />Born a slave in 1841, Bruce became a local Mississippi sheriff, developed a growing Republican power base, amassed a real-estate fortune, and became the first black to serve a full Senate term. He married Josephine Willson, the daughter of a wealthy black Philadelphia doctor. Together they broke racial barriers as a socialite couple in 1880s Washington, D.C.<br /><br />By befriending President Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and a cadre of liberal black and white Republicans, Bruce spent six years in the U.S. Senate, then gained appointments under four presidents (Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, and McKinley), culminating with a top Treasury post, which placed his name on all U.S. currency.<br /><br />During Reconstruction, the Bruce family entertained lavishly in their two Washington town houses and acquired an 800-acre plantation, homes in four states, and a fortune that allowed their son and grandchildren to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, beginning in 1896.<br /><br />The Senator's legacy would continue with his son, Roscoe, who became both a protégé of Booker T. Washington and a superintendent of Washington, D.C.'s segregated schools. When the family moved to New York in the 1920s and formed an alliance with John D. Rockefeller Jr., the Bruces became an enviable force in Harlem society. Their public battle to get their grandson admitted into Harvard University's segregated dormitories elicited the support of people like W. E. B. Du Bois and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and broke brave new ground for blacks of their day.<br /><br />But in the end, the Bruce dynasty's wealth and stature would disappear when the Senator's grandson landed in prison following a sensational trial and his Radcliffe-educated granddaughter married a black Hollywood actor who passed for white.<br /><br />By drawing on Senate records, historic documents, and the personal letters of Senator Bruce, Josephine, their colleagues, friends, children, and grandchildren, author Lawrence Otis Graham weaves a riveting social history that spans 120 years. From Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to New York, <em>The Senator and the Socialite</em> provides a fascinating look into the history of race and class in America."

But in the shadows of the empire, the talk is of murder. Who among his associates has the cunning and skill to fell the fierce leader -- and brave the dangerous consequences of that cataclysmic act?"

The reader is swept into the whirlpool of pageantry, passion, splendor, chaos and earth-shattering upheaval that was ancient Rome. Here is the story of Marius, wealthy but lowborn, and Sulla, aristocratic but penniless and debauched -- extraordinary men of vision whose ruthless ambition will lay the foundations of the most awesome and enduring empire known to humankind.<br /><br />A towering saga of great events and mortal frailties, it is peopled with a vast, and vivid cast of unforgettable men and women -- soldiers and senators, mistresses and wives, kings and commoners -- combined in a richly embroidered human tapestry to bring a remarkable era to bold and breathtaking life."

Here is powerful King Agamemnon with his terrifyingly ambitious wife Klytemnestra and his soothsaying mistress Kassandra. We meet Odysseus, doomed to wander the Aegean for twenty long years; brave Achilles, who is haunted by the mad shade of his mother; the heroes Hektor and Ajax, and many more.<br /><br />Chapter by chapter the narrative is handed from one character to another as the long years of siege, bloody battles, love and death unfold and the gods exact their retribution. With extraordinary vividness Colleen McCullough engages our sympathy for each character and gives this ancient saga a contemporary sense of urgency and excitement. <br /><br />An unputdownable read and the best possible way to introduce a new generation of readers to one of the greatest stories ever told."

Births, deaths, prophecies and rivalries combine to create a whirlwind of drama, and a remarkable insight into the passion and torment of ancient Rome."

A Brief History of the End of the World: Apocalyptic Beliefs from Revelation to UFO Cults,,Simon Pearson,,7251,,Running Press,320,,,,"Most people's concept of the 'end of the world' comes from the book of Revelation. Today, there are an estimated 25 million Christian fundamentalists in the US who believe it will come with the 'Rapture;' others point to an ecological catastrophe, the AIDS pandemic, nuclear and biological warfare. With the benefit of a vast historical canvas, Pearson examines both apocalyptic theory (biblical literature, art, and popular culture) and practice (politics, cults, war, and revolution), from its Biblical beginnings to the Branch Davidians, via the Vikings, the French Revolution, the Pilgrim Fathers, Hitler's Apocalyptic rhetoric, asteroids, Hollywood and suicide bombers.

A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape.

The inspiration for this novel came from Nicholas Sparks's sister: her life and her courage. From the internationally bestselling author Nicholas Sparks, comes his most moving story yet...."

Icy Sparks,,Gwyn Hyman Rubio,eng,1004778,,Penguin Group,320,,,,"Icy Sparks is the sad, funny and transcendent tale of a young girl growing up in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky during the 1950’s. Gwyn Hyman Rubio’s beautifully written first novel revolves around Icy Sparks, an unforgettable heroine in the tradition of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird or Will Treed in Cold Sassy Tree. At the age of ten, Icy, a bright, curious child orphaned as a baby but raised by adoring grandparents, begins to have strange experiences. Try as she might, her ""secrets""—verbal croaks, groans, and physical spasms—keep afflicting her. As an adult, she will find out she has Tourette’s Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but for years her behavior is the source of mystery, confusion, and deep humiliation.<br /><br />Narrated by a grown up Icy, the book chronicles a difficult, but ultimately hilarious and heartwarming journey, from her first spasms to her self-acceptance as a young woman. Curious about life beyond the hills, talented, and energetic, Icy learns to cut through all barriers—physical, mental, and spiritual—in order to find community and acceptance."

His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle <br /><br />Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: <br /><br />My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... <br /><br />For ""Garrett,"" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? <br /><br />Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. <br /><br />Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most..."

Her girlfriends, however, disapprove. And when they secretly place a personal ad on a hot singles website on her behalf, Jess is reluctantly hurtled into the topsy-turvy world of online dating. A laugh-out-loud whirlwind of disastrous dates ensues, from Simon, who seems dreamy over e-mail but ditches her at the dinner table, leaving her with the bill, to Graham, a self-described “Ferrari driver” who turns out to be a car salesman—with several (old, fat, bald, creepy, cheap, stuck-up) men in between. When an unforeseen event turns her world upside down, Jess starts to wonder if the qualities she thinks she wants in a man—gorgeous, wildly successful, with a taste for fun and the finer things—really are what she ultimately needs . . . and whether, as a new mystery suitor appears in her e-mail inbox, Cupid has other possibilities up his sleeve.<br /><br />Told with Jane Moore’s sparkling wit, wisdom, and sass,<i> Love @ First Site</i> is an irresistible tale about what happens when we start to look for love between the lines on a computer screen—and a winning, unputdownable look at contemporary romance."

The Modern Prince and Other Writings: And Other Writings,,Antonio Gramsci,eng,7345,,International Publishers,192,,,,"Antonio Gramsci has become, over the years, the most beloved intellectual of left minded thinkers and actors. His views on 'hegemony', 'oreganic intellectuals' and his conceren for 'unity of theory and action' are considered his greatest contributions to the socialist/communist movements. Even left-popularism of these modern days can apply these views. Gramsci had a good slice of anarchism by distrusting the center of any organisation, political party and government. He is the father of democracy and communism. Modern majority worker-ownership movements can attribute their existence to Gramsci as well as Marshall Tito in the Balkins. The fascist dictator Mussoline had Gramsci imprisoned for 11 years in the 1920's and 30's where he continued to write in code as his health worsened. He was released from prison and died soon afterwards. A Collector's Edition."

Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography,,Nick Rennison,eng,802713,U.S. Edition,Atlantic Monthly Press,304,,,,"He has been called a genius and a fraud, a hero and an addict. He advised kings in their glittering palaces, then disappeared into the darkest alleys of London’s criminal underworld. He was (and remains) a global icon, but he could pass his most ardent fan on the street without a flicker of recognition. Who was this Sherlock Holmes? With an attention to detail that would make his subject envious, Nick Rennison gathers the clues of a life lived among the stars of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, from Oscar Wilde to Sigmund Freud, and uncovers startling, previously unknown information. How did a Cambridge drop-out and bit player on the London stage transform himself into a renowned “consulting detective”? Did he know the identity of “Jack the Ripper”? When did Holmes and his nemesis Professor Moriarty first cross paths? To where did Sherlock Holmes disappear after his presumed “death” in 1891? <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> answers these questions and many more as it careens through the most infamous crimes and historic events of the era, all in pursuit of the real man behind the greatest detective in modern fiction—and, just perhaps, non-fiction."

The story collections <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> feature such renowned tales as “A Scandal in Bohemia,” “The Red-Headed League,” and “The Musgrave Ritual.”<br /><br />Tired of writing stories about Holmes, his creator, <b>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b>, killed him off at the end of “The Final Problem,” the last tale in <i>The Memoirs</i>. But the public outcry was so great that eight years later he published the masterful <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, which supposedly takes place before Holmes’s death.<br /><br />The separate <i>Volume II</i> of <i>The Complete Sherlock Holmes</i> collects the remaining accounts of Holmes’s exploits, including “The Adventure of the Empty House,” which reveals the elaborate circumstances behind Holmes’s literary resurrection.<br /><br /><b>Kyle Freeman</b>, a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast for many years, earned two graduate degrees in English literature from Columbia University, where his major was twentieth-century British literature.<br /><br />(front flap)<br /><br />A study in scarlet --<br />The sign of four --<br />Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

And in the Zapatistas, we have not one dream of a revolution but a dreaming revolution.”—Naomi Klein<br /><br />The most comprehensive collection of essays and communiqués by Subcomandante Marcos chronicles the written voice of the Zapatista movement and its struggle to open a space within the neoliberal, globalized landscape for the oppressed peoples of the world. Complete from their first public appearance in 1994 through their 10-year anniversary celebrations and period of restructuring in 2004.<br /><br />“The Zapatista uprising in Chiapas was certainly one of the most dramatic and important instances in our time of a genuine grassroots movement against oppression. In this volume, the writings of Subcomandante Marcos give eloquent expression to this movement, revealing both its philo-sophical foundations and its tactical ingenuity. I believe his words and the statements of the Zapatistas can inspire a new generation of activists and let them understand that it is possible for ordinary people, without military power, without wealth, to challenge state power successfully on behalf of social justice. [This] fantastic collection of Marcos’ words conveys the spirit of the Zapatistas as no other book I know has done.”—Howard Zinn<br /><br />“After over 500 years of conquest, the indigenous -people already know what the rest of us must learn about empires: that they exploit the many for the privileges of the few, that they ransack the cultures of antiquity, that they place a burden even on the mother countries. But in their actions and writings, the Zapatistas are inspiring a new generation to join the struggle for a better world. It’s our world too!”—Tom Hayden"

</b><br />When obsessed pet owners have pooches or kitties they want immortalized on canvas, Kate Disney is the artist of choice. From her shed (which doubles as a studio and apartment) in London’s Primrose Hill, Kate caters to the whims of the rich and famous while herself living a decidedly bohemian existence. The problem is, she has a tendency to cater to her on-again, way-off-again boyfriend as well. Jake is so erratic, that most of her friends don’t understand why she even bothers. But it’s hard to fall out of love with a man who writes her songs and calls her “Angel”–even if he disappears for weeks at a time. <br /><br />Luckily for Kate, Mirabelle Moncur isn’t buying any of that claptrap. Mirri was an actress, a legend in her time. Now, at age sixty, she’s given up on fame and men and lives in Africa, where she raises lion cubs. But her reclusive nature has done nothing to dull her beauty, mar her incredible figure, or dampen her outrageous joie de vivre.<br /><br />After sweeping into London to have Kate paint a portrait of her favorite cub, Mirri seizes hold of Kate’s life–from the baggy wardrobe to the hopeless taste in men. Under Mirri’s tutelage, Kate learns to dance on tables with abandon, drink like a dockworker, and flirt like a goddess. And when her old friend Louis reenters the picture, she begins to see things in a whole new light. But Mirri has secrets that hint at a less than divine future. Now it’s Kate’s turn to teach Mirri a thing or two about life, love, and being fabulous.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

For one, there's the new nine-to-five: the unbelievably glamorous, frenzied chore of coddling (doing PR for) the stars--not to mention the bevy of gorgeous, stick-thin models who suddenly appear in Alice's orbit and the suntan/convertible lifestyle that taunts her pasty-white self (starting with her thighs).

Or maybe it's Tommy, the unbelievably beautiful and totally wasted movie star? Because if truth be told, Alice doesn't think it's all that strange, this stalker business.

The Emperor's Children,,Claire Messud,,3255539,First Edition,Alfred A.

The delicious complications that arise among them become dangerous when Murray’s nephew, Frederick “Bootie” Tubb, an idealistic college dropout determined to make his mark, comes to town. As the skies darken, it is Bootie’s unexpected decisions—and their stunning, heartbreaking outcome—that will change each of their lives forever. <br /><br />A richly drawn, brilliantly observed novel of fate and fortune—of innocence and experience, seduction and self-invention; of ambition, including literary ambition; of glamour, disaster, and promise—The Emperor’s Children is a tour de force that brings to life a city, a generation, and the way we live in this moment."
The Last Life,,Claire Messud,eng,937447,,Mariner Books,400,,,,"Remembrance of Things Past<br />""I find myself wanting to translate the world inside...""<br /><br />Sagesse LaBasse, the teenage protagonist of Claire Messud's <i>The Last Life</i>, lives in a fragile world held together by the secrets of its past. Her family owns the Hotel Bellevue, a summer retreat for the well-to-do, set on the cliffs of southern France; the view is back toward Algeria, which her paternal grandparents fled during its struggle for independence from France. As her grandmother laments, ""Every morning, I wake up and look out my window at the Mediterranean sea, vast and creeping, and I smell the pines and the heat on the breeze, rising up the clifftop, and I'm in Algiers again. I live, still, in my heart, in Algeria."" <br /><br />The loss of their homeland is always present to the LaBasses, and the consequent search for identity both reflects and compounds other difficulties. Sagesse's father (""fleshy, ingratiating, explosive"") languishes under his own father's control, and is often unfaithful to Sagesse's mother, an American who tries to pass as French. Meanwhile, their young son, Etienne, is so severely mentally and physically impaired that his birth is likened to ""the clanging of their prison door."" Sagesse's grandmother looks on with cool resignation, and her grandfather, the family's hot-headed patriarch, will let no one rest. When, late one night, the old man fires his rifle into a group of children swimming at the hotel's pool, no one is seriously injured, but the family's livelihood is put at risk, and long-simmering resentments find an outlet.<br /><br />Sagesse is the perfect narrator for this fractured situation. She is neither French, nor American; not a girl, yet not quite a woman. Her grandfather's rash act causes her to lose her friends at school, and she is forced to ""seek out the very pot-smokers I had...readily disparaged little over a month before."" These new friends, upon realizing her family's past (having been French colonists, they are suspected of being racists, and members of the National Front) and relative wealth, also abandon her. With guests trickling away from the hotel, and tensions rising within the LaBasse family, Sagesse tries to understand what remains, and what place there might be for her. <br /><br />Fortunately, while her life may be painful, she never finds it dull. Sagesse's language is rich and evocative, full of descriptive power. Here, for example, she witnesses the market: ""There were vegetable men and fruit women and stalls selling both, blushing mounds of peaches alongside plump and purple eggplants...pale, splayed organs of fennel pressing their ridged tubes and feathered ends up against the sugar-speckled, wrinkled carcasses of North African dates...the fishmongers sold their bullet-eyed, silver-skinned, slippery catch, blood-streaked fillets and orbed, scored steaks, milky scallops and encrusted oysters...."" And here, a painting of the Bay of Algiers: ""its apron of azure sea, erratically white-capped, broken by the sandstone finger of the port...the white rise of the city, a thousand precise terraces and roofs climbing into the sunlit sky, the European curlicues and the higgledy-piggledy casbah, all their outlines drawn as if with a single hair, interspersed with delicate little palms and cypresses and other trees of variegated greens, and with broad, brown avenues like branches.""<br /><br />A brilliant, complex world is formed by the accretion of these images, and they are juxtaposed and spur each other seamlessly, multiplying atmosphere and complicating plot lines. While most of the novel's events take place around 1990, Sagesse tells of them from a time almost a decade later (when she is a graduate student of the ""history of ideas"" at Columbia). This frame, constructed of occasional asides and short passages, allows a fluidity where revelations from the past and future cause momentum to shift and whirl -- the dead rise, their movements sharper and words more portentous with the reader's knowledge of coming tragedy. This later perspective also enables Sagesse to add deft hints and wise commentary. Looking back on herself, for instance, she says, ""Children do not have words to ask and so do not imagine asking; not asking and not imagining, they eradicate distance: they take for granted that everything, someday, will be understood.""<br /><br /><i>The Last Life</i> stands as a testament to reflection, to making sense of an unruly past. It is also a kind of autobiography, an attempt to constitute an identity. In its ebb and flow of images, action, and ideas, the narrative deals so well with this attempt, implicitly, that it's unfortunate that it must also be treated explicitly. Frequent asides concerning identity and the nature of the self (""the one thing that would not leave me: the only and inadequate definition of my 'I.'"") seem unnecessary; they lure Sagesse into self-dramatization, and contain the novel's most uneven prose. Some readers may find that such self-analysis helps characterize the narrator, but it's difficult to believe the story wouldn't be stronger without it. <br /><br />Still, the novel's concern with such weighty questions is representative of its, and Sagesse's, fearlessness. As she seeks the truth about her family and herself, she also reflects on politics and race, dreaming of a ""Mediterranean culture democratic and polyphonous"" while simultaneously acknowledging its impossibility. This seeming contradiction must be borne, she learns, since to blindly accept what has happened is to forget alternatives and to repeat mistakes. ""I live as if this might-have-been existed,"" she writes, ""shimmering in the imaginary; and if it is but an 'as if,' I have learned, then it is none the less real for that.""<br /><br /><i>The Last Life</i> ultimately concerns itself with questions of fate and self-determination. In a world of disasters, Sagesse wonders if and how they might have been avoided: ""The abiding question...was it fate? Is our ending inscribed in our beginning -- and, if so, in whose beginning?"" The ""obvious answer,"" she says, is that we cannot escape our fate, that our choices are illusory. The richness found in her story, however, suggests the less obvious answer -- that we might affect our fate, and better confront the present and future, if we work to come to an understanding with our past."

Her prim and pious sister, Virginia, meanwhile, has never wandered far outside of London. Struggling to find meaning, she follows her aging mother’s advice to vacation on the Isle of Skye. On these two islands halfway around the world, the middle-aged sisters confront the costs of self-knowledge and their destinies with unexpected consequences.<br /><br /><br />“A novelist of unnerving talent.”—<em>New York Times Book Review</em><br /><br /><br />“[Messud] has the daring and assurance to take on Iris Murdoch–like questions about goodness and truth.”—<em>The New Yorker</em><br /><br /><br />“Beautiful. . . . [Messud] has the imagination, the craft and the understanding of human nature to write about anything she chooses.”—<em>Chicago Tribune</em>"
La vie après,,Claire Messud,fre,937447,,,,,,,"Claire Messud's piercing second novel asks questions most are too fearful to face. Moving between the South of France, the East Coast of the U.S., and Algeria, <i>The Last Life</i> explores the weight of isolation and exile in one French family. Of course, the adjective <i>French</i> is already inadequate, as at least some of the LaBasses still long for the paradise lost of Algeria. And Alex LaBasse's wife, Carol, try as she might with her Continental impersonations, will always be an American sporting a metaphorical twin set. The narrator, Sagesse, too, soon finds herself equally stranded. Only her autocratic grandfather, Jacques, is ostensibly comfortable with the identity he has wrought: successful owner of the Bellevue Hotel and head of his dynasty. It is thanks to this man that 14-year-old Sagesse comes to crave invisibility. Having lost of all of her friends, she sees herself as ""a member of the Witness Protection Program, surrounded by an odd human assortment chosen only for the efficiency of disguise; but somehow, nevertheless, inescapable.""<br /><br />The cause of this loss? Jacques, fed up with Sagesse and her pals' late-night noise at the hotel pool--or perhaps with their failure to take him seriously--shoots at one girl. This incident ruptures life for each LaBasse, the Bellevue no longer ""their bulwark against absurdity."" Looking back on the crucial two years following the patriarch's ""target practice,"" Sagesse possesses both a teenager's slant self-interest and an older, acute eye for the mechanisms of shame. <i>The Last Life</i> is that rare thing, a fast-moving philosophical novel masquerading as a bildungsroman. In her efforts at identity and affection, its heroine is increasingly alive to the subterfuges of narrative, forcing herself to sort through versions of reality. Her grandmother, for instance, relates one myth about her husband, only to have Carol undercut it entirely. And Sagesse herself can't figure out whether Jacques is ""sentimental or heartless."" What if both, she realizes, are possible?<br /><br />As Messud's narrator navigates her way through the past--and the Algerian sections are among the book's most extraordinary--there is everything to savor in her wavelike sentences, many of which possess a dangerously witty undertow. And the scenes of familial tedium are the opposite of tedious. The dialogue snaps with subverted emotion, anxiety, and irony. At one of the LaBasses' bleaker fests, much is made of the <i>mouna</i>, a special (if dry) Algerian cake. Nonetheless, the grandmother does her best to fob it off at evening's end. ""I've never cared for it myself, although it's a lovely memory."" Retrospect, as Sagesse realizes, is ""a light in which we may not see more clearly, but at least have the illusion of doing so."""

Efficiency expert Mark Forster shows that prioritizing tasks is never a sufficient approach to organizing a schedule, and is rarely even helpful. In the place of prioritization he posits several radical new ideas, including closed lists, the manyana principle, and the 'will do&amp;' list. Innovative forms of communication that are designed to produce effective conversation and planning are also provided. The result is a complete system which will boost efficiency and simultaneously decrease stress and overworking."

If we're not vigilant about planning our days, time can slip away at the expense of our personal fulfillment. According to Mark Forster, the key to getting everything done is repeated, consistent, and focused action. He shows us how to put this plan into practice: get moving and overcome resistance and procrastination, make the maximum use of available time, allocate work time and free time, cope with interruptions and emergencies, and learn to manage time by saying No!"

How to Make Your Dreams Come True,,Mark Forster,,7450,,Hodder & Stoughton,208,,,,"Most people think of life as either something that happens to them or as something which they have to bend to their will. Life in short is seen as a series of problems requiring solutions. As a result people spend much of their lives either in escape activities or driving themselves to achieve, often both at the same time.But life becomes qualitatively different when we see it as a theatre in which we decide what is going to happen and then let it happen in the way that an artist will allow his or her creation to appear. This book is an example of the message that it teaches. Forster records methodically how he himself stopped struggling to work against his own feelings and to let his life happen. Exciting and inspiring, his own story with accompanying exercises for the reader prove the life-changing fact - that when we give priority to the workings of our unconscious minds we can trust them not to let us down."

He has been married for thirty years to Kiki, an American woman who no longer resembles the sexy activist she once was. Their three children passionately pursue their own paths: Levi quests after authentic blackness, Zora believes that intellectuals can redeem everybody, and Jerome struggles to be a believer in a family of strict atheists. Faced with the oppressive enthusiasms of his children, Howard feels that the first two acts of his life are over and he has no clear plans for the finale. Or the encore.<br /><br />Then Jerome, Howard's older son, falls for Victoria, the stunning daughter of the right-wing icon Monty Kipps, and the two families find themselves thrown together in a beautiful corner of America, enacting a cultural and personal war against the background of real wars that they barely register. An infidelity, a death, and a legacy set in motion a chain of events that sees all parties forced to examine the unarticulated assumptions which underpin their lives.

And what is the beautiful thing, and how far will you go to get it?<br /><br />Set on both sides of the Atlantic, Zadie Smith's third novel is a brilliant analysis of family life, the institution of marriage, intersections of the personal and political, and an honest look at people's deceptions.

Beauty Junkies: Inside Our $15 Billion Obsession With Cosmetic Surgery,,Alex Kuczynski,,7457,,,,,,,"A star writer for the<i> New York Times </i>Styles section captures the follies, frauds, and fanaticism that fuel the American pursuit of youth and beauty in a wickedly revealing excursion into the burgeoning business of cosmetic enhancement.<br /><br />Americans are aging faster and getting fatter than any other population on the planet. At the same time, our popular notions of perfect beauty have become so strict it seems even Barbie wouldn’t have a chance of making it into the local beauty pageant. <br /><br />Aging may be a natural fact of life, but for a growing number of Americans its hallmarks—wrinkles, love handles, jiggling flesh—are seen as obstacles to be conquered on the path to lasting, flawless beauty. In <i>Beauty Junkies</i> Alex Kuczynski, whose sly wit and fearless reporting in the<i> Times </i>has won her fans across the country, delivers a fresh and irresistible look at America's increasingly desperate pursuit of ultimate beauty by any means necessary. <br /><br />From a group of high-maintenance New York City women who devote themselves to preserving their looks twenty-four hours a day, to a “surgery safari” in South Africa complete with “after” photographs of magically rejuvenated patients posing with wild animals, to a podiatrist's office in Manhattan where a “foot face-lift” provides women with the right fit for their $700 Jimmy Choos, Kuczynski portrays the all-American quest for self-transformation in all its extremes. In New York, lawyers become Botox junkies in an effort to remain poker-faced. In Los Angeles, women of an uncertain age nip and tuck their most private areas, so that every inch of their bodies is as taut as their lifted faces. Across the country, young women graduating from high school receive gifts of breast implants – from their parents. <br /><br />As medicine and technology stretch the boundaries of biology, Kuczynski asks whether cosmetic surgery might even be part of human evolution, a kind of cosmetic survival of the fittest – or firmest? With incomparable portraits of obsessive patients and the equally obsessed doctors who cater to their dreams, <i>Beauty Junkies</i> examines the hype, the hope, and the questionable ethics surrounding the advent of each new miraculous technique. Lively and entertaining, thought-provoking and disturbing, <i>Beauty Junkies</i> is destined to be one of the most talked-about books of the season."

The foreigners of the city are refugees, each washed up on the banks of the Paraná by some inner disaster or defeat: Dr. Eduardo Plarr, a physician, whose English father has vanished into a Paraguayan prison, and for whom ""caring is the only dangerous thing""; Humphries, a teacher of English, who has touched bottom and accepted it; Charley Fortnum, the Honorary Consul, who at the age of sixty-one, sustained by drink and his disputed status as British Consul, still retains enough hope and illusion to marry a twenty-year-old girl from Señora Sanchez' brothel...<br /><br />With gathering force, Graham Greene draws his characters into the political chaos that lies beneath the surface of South American life. Fortnum is kidnapped by Paraguayan revolutionaries who have mistaken him for the American Ambassador. Realizing their error, they threaten to execute him anyway if their demands are not met. Plarr, torn between his instinctive feeling for the revolutionaries -- one of whom is an old friend -- and his ambiguous relationship with Fortnum, whose wife he has taken as a lover, becomes involved in a tragicomedy that leads inexorably to a meaningless death.<br /><br />At the center of <i>The Honorary Consul</i> is Plarr, a brilliant Graham Greene creation, perhaps the most moving and convincing figure in his fiction. Plarr is a man so cut off from human feeling, so puzzled by the emotional needs of men like Fortnum, that he is paradoxically vulnerable, chillingly exposed, and required in the end to pay with his life for the illusions that other people believe in and that he himself cannot share.<br /><br />In the men and women who surround Plarr -- Clara, who has moved from the brothel to Charley Fortnum's bedroom; Father Rivas, the revolutionary priest who dominates those near him, despite his unsanctified marriage and belief in political terror; Saavedra, the Argentinean novelist, whose work lugubriously mirrors the world around him; Aquino, the poet-turned-revolutionary; Colonel Perez, the cheerfully efficient chief of police -- Graham Greene has created a world peculiarly his own. It is a world illuminated by that special passion for the complexities of love, faith, compassion, and betrayal that lies at the very heart of his work."

Galardonada con los premios Whitbread y Guardian, además de quedar finalista en todos los demás concursos literarios importantes de Gran Bretaña, <i>Dientes blancos</i> ha sido portada del <i>New York Times</i> y <i>Le Monde</i> y, por si fuera poco, ha ocupado los primeros puestos en las listas de libros más vendidos en ambas orillas del Atlántico.<br /><br />Situado en un barrio londinense de inmigrantes, el inmenso fresco humano que dibuja la autora tiene como epicentro las familias de Archie Jones y Samad Iqbal, dos ex combatientes de la Segunda Guerra Mundial que vuelven a encontrarse después de treinta años sin verse.

Uno trabaja en un taller de manipulados de papel y el otro se gana el sustento de camarero en un restaurante, pero su mayor problema no ha sido la guerra, ni la falta de dinero, ni el hecho de estar casados con mujeres jóvenes de carácter endemoniado. No, la prueba más dura que les ha deparado la vida es la relación con sus hijos. Éstos, que deberían llevar a cabo los proyectos fracasados de sus padres, se rebelan. Se rebelan contra el racismo británico, contra su propia clase social, incluso contra sus orígenes, su historia y su barrio.

Seine Themen drehen sich um Herkunft, Religion, Geschlechterbeziehungen, Hautfarbe, gesellschaftliche Stellung und Geschichte, aber Zadie Smith ist mit einem Witz und einem Einfallsreichtum gesegnet, die diese gewichtigen Ideen mühelos leicht erscheinen lassen.<p> Die Handlung führt uns nach Jamaika, die Türkei, Bangladesch und Indien und bringt uns schließlich in einen schäbigen Vorort von North London, in dem die zwei merkwürdigen Helden dieses Buches zu Hause sind: Archie Jones, der es mit der Wahrheit nicht so genau nimmt, und Samad Iqbal, der im hohen Maße dem Alkohol zuspricht. Sie begegneten sich erstmals im Zweiten Weltkrieg als Mitglieder eines vom Pech verfolgten Bataillons und sind seitdem unzertrennlich. Archie heiratet die schöne Clara mit den vorstehenden Zähnen, die sich auf der Flucht vor ihrer Mutter befindet, einer Zeugin Jehovas, und mit der er eine Tochter hat, Irie. Samad heiratet die pampige Alsana, die ihm zwei stramme Jungs schenkt -- Zwillinge: ""Kinder mit Vor- und Zunamen, die sich auf direktem Kollisionskurs befinden; Namen, hinter denen sich Massenexodus, überfüllte Boote und Flugzeuge, unfreundliche Ankünfte und ärztliche Untersuchungen verbergen.""</p><p> Große Fragen verlangen nach kühn gezeichneten Charakteren. Zadie Smiths Helden sind nicht heroisch; sie sind einfach echt: warmherzig, komisch, fehlgeleitet und absolut vertraut. Wenn man ihre Unterhaltungen liest, kommt man sich vor, als würde man sie heimlich belauschen. In einer ganz einfachen Szene unterhalten sich Alsana und Clara im Park über ihre Schwangerschaften: ""Eine Frau muss ihre privaten Dinge haben -- ein Ehemann sollte sich nicht in die körperlichen Angelegenheiten einmischen, in den Intimbereich einer Frau.""</p><p> Samad ist verärgert über seine Söhne: ""Sie sind beide vom Weg abgekommen; so weit weg von dem, was ich für sie geplant hatte. Es gibt wohl keinen Zweifel, dass sie beide irgendwann weiße Frauen heiraten werden, die Sheila heißen, und mich früh unter die Erde bringen."" Hier spiegeln sich ""die Ängste des Einwanderers -- Identitätsverlust, Auflösung"" -- deutlich wider, die Samad mehr als alles andere geprägt haben.</p><p> Die Lektüre von <i>Zähne zeigen</i> ist eine wahre Freude. In diesem Buch wimmelt es vor Leben und Überschwänglichkeit, und doch besitzt es genug Schläue und despektierliche Seriosität, um ihm eine gewisse Bissigkeit zu geben. <i>--Eithne Farry</i></p>"

Vance Packard & American Social Criticism,,Daniel Horowitz,,7489,,University of North Carolina Press,400,,,,"Vance Packard's bestselling books--<i>Hidden Persuaders</i> (1957), <i>Status Seekers</i> (1959), and <i>Waste Makers</i> (1960)--taught the generation that came of age in the late 1950s and early 1960s about the dangers posed by advertising, social climbing, and planned obsolescence. Like Betty Friedan and William H. Whyte, Jr., Packard (1914- ) was a journalist who played an important role in the nation's transition from the largely complacent 1950s to the tumultuous 1960s. He was also one of the first social critics to benefit from and foster the newly energized social and political consciousness of this period. Based in part on interviews with Packard, Daniel Horowitz's intellectual biography focuses on the period during which Packard left magazine writing to author his most famous works of social criticism. Horowitz traces the influence of Packard's education and early years in rural Pennsylvania, providing a deeper understanding of his thought and his later books. Packard's life, Horowitz contends, illuminates the dilemmas of a freelance social critic without inherited wealth or academic affiliation. His career also expands our understanding of how one era shaped the next, underscoring how the adversarial 1960s drew on the mass culture of the previous decade.<br /><br />Originally published in 1994.<br /><br />A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

Central to the selection are several self-contained passages from Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage to the Holy Land (1876), a book-length work that Warren calls ""an important document of our modernity ... in fact, a precursor to The Waste Land, with the same central image, the same flickering contrasts of the past and the present, the same charade of belief and unbelief.""""

Thomas Tanselle', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Herman Melville,eng,7492,,Library of America,1436,,,,"Between 1849 and 1851, Melville wrote three masterful stories of the sea (including the classic <em>Moby-Dick</em>) that captured colorful and comic glimpses of shipboard life, the excitement of the whale hunt, and seascapes that move from the brutal to the sublime; they also displayed a marvelous command of language that mixes the ordinary talk of sailors with the rhythms of the Bible and Shakespearean hyperbole. Together the works in this <em>Library of America</em> volume reveal Melville’s obsession with the possibilities of human freedom, the sacrifice of that freedom to the demands of social cohesion, and the submission of social groups—represented by the shipboard community—to traditional forms of authority."

With the publication of this <em>Library of America</em> volume, the third of three volumes, all Melville's fiction has now been restored to print for the first time.<br /><br /><i>Pierre; or, The Ambiguities</i>, published in 1852 (the year after <i>Moby-Dick</i>), moves between the idyllic Berkshire countryside and the nightmare landscape of early New York City. Its hero, a young American patrician trying to redeem the secret sins of his father, elopes to the city, discovers Bohemian life, attempts a literary epic, and struggles his way through incest, murder, and madness. Long a controversial work, it is Melville's darkest satire of American life and letters and one of his most powerful books.<br /><br />A pivotal work, both for Melville's career and for American literature, <i>Pierre</i> was followed by <i>Israel Potter</i>, the story of a veteran of the Revolution, victim of a thousand mischances, and a long-suffering exile in England. Along the way are memorable episodes of war and intrigue, with personal portraits of Benjamin Franklin, John Paul Jones, and George III. In the exploits of this touchingly optimistic soldier, Melville offers a scathing image of the collapse of revolutionary hopes.<br /><i><br />The Piazza Tales</i> demonstrates Melville's dazzling mastery of many styles, including ""The Encantadas,"" about nature's two faces--enchanting and horrific; the famous ""Bartleby the Scrivener,"" about a Wall Street copyist who ""would prefer not to""; and the enigmatic ""Benito Cereno,"" about a credulous Yankee sea captain who stumbles into an intricately plotted mutiny aboard a disabled slave ship.<br /><i><br />The Confidence-Man</i>, Melville's last published novel, is in many ways a forerunner of modernist American fiction. An extended meditation on faith, hope, and charity as these are manifested on board a Mississippi riverboat one April Fools' Day, it presents a menagerie of Americans buying and selling, borrowing and lending, believing and mistrusting, as they are carried toward the auction blocks of New Orleans.<br /><br />Many pieces never before collected are also included: the ""Authentic Anecdotes of Old Zack"" (burlesque sketches of Zachary Taylor's Mexican campaign), ""Fragments from a Writing-Desk"" (Melville's earliest surviving prose), reviews of Hawthorne, Parkman, and Cooper, and all the tales Melville published in magazines during the 1850s.<br /><br />Finally, there is the posthumously published masterpiece <i>Billy Budd, Sailor</i>, the haunting story of a beautiful, innocent sailor who is pressed into naval service, slandered, provoked to murder, and sacrificed to military justice. While encouraging questions for which there are no answers, it invites us to meditate on the conflicts central to all Melville's work: between freedom and fate, innocence and civilized corruption."
The Poems of Herman Melville,,Douglas Robillard,,7494,,Kent State University Press,368,,,,"Unlike his fiction, which has been popular and often reprinted, Melville's poetry remains obscure.

In this revised edition of his Poems of Herman Melville, Douglas Robillard updates the scholarship on the poetry through his introduction and notes and makes a case for revised estimate of the importance of Melville as a poet. The Poems of Herman Melville contains entire texts of ""Battle-Pieces"" (1866), ""John Marr and Other Sailors"" (1888), and ""Timoleon"" (1891). Selected cantos from ""Clarel"" are reprinted with accompanying notes and commentary."

Mocked by the crew on board the Highlander for his weakness and bullied by the vicious and merciless sailor Jackson, Wellingborough must struggle to endure the long journey from New York to Liverpool. But when he does reach England, he is equally horrified by what he finds there: poverty, desperation and moral corruption. Inspired by Melville's own youthful experiences on board a cargo ship, this is a compelling tale of innocence transformed, through bitter experience, into disillusionment. A fascinating sea journal and coming-of-age tale, Redburn provides a unique insight into the mind of one of America's greatest novelists."

These three early novels are stirring romances of the South Seas; many of their fictional details resemble some of the events in Melville’s own life in the early 1840s. Like the hero-narrator of <em>Typee</em> and <em>Omoo</em>, Melville shipped out on a whaler, jumped ship in exotic ports, was held captive by native tribes—though here he might have exaggerated his own exploits a bit—and escaped to find passage home in the service of the United States Navy.<br /><br />Exuberant, highly pictorial, with a clear, swift narrative, <em>Typee</em> (1846) was his most popular work well into the 20th century, outselling all his others, including Moby-Dick. It offers a mostly idyllic account of life among the “cannibals” in which civilized innocence is contrasted with the corrosive effects of 19th-century industrial society.<br /><br />A sequel to <em>Typee</em>, <em>Omoo</em> (1847) continues this inquiry into Pacific culture and those who intruded upon it, specifically in Tahiti. Melville details the misadventures of the unruly and overworked crew of the Australian trader Julia after they are imprisoned for insubordination; the story will perhaps surprise today’s readers with its humor.<br /><br />With <em>Mardi</em> (1849), Melville abandons a literary Polynesia for a mythical one. “Mardi” is the Polynesian word for “the world,” and the voyage through imaginary South Sea archipelagoes stops off at Dominora (Britain), Porpheero (Europe), and Vivenza (the United States). Tracing the quest for the elusive and beautiful Yillah, it remains a timely political allegory and a thrilling adventure.<br /><br />Together, these three romances give early evidence of the genius and daring that make Melville the master novelist of the sea and a precursor of modernist literature."

While it stunned the public and literary establishment when it was published in 1957, it is now recognized as an American classic. With <b>On the Road</b>, Kerouac discovered his voice and his true subject—the search for a place as an outsider in America.<b>On the Road</b> swings to the rhythms of fifties underground America, jazz, sex, generosity, chill dawns, and drugs, with Sal Paradise and his hero Dean Moriarty, traveler and mystic, the living epitome of Beat."
Desolation Angels,,Jack Kerouac,,2956030,,Flamingo,397,66197,Duluoz Legend,,"Desolation Angels, published in 1965, yet written years earlier around the time On the Road was in the process of publication, is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac, which makes up part of his Duluoz Legend. According to the book's foreword, the opening section of the novel is almost directly taken from the journal he kept when he was a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascade mountains of Washington state. Much of the psychological struggle which the novel's protagonist, Jack Duluoz, undergoes in the novel reflects Kerouac's own increasing disenchantment with the Buddhist philosophy with which he had previously been fascinated."

In August of the following year, Kerouac began writing down prose poem ""sketches"" in small notebooks that he kept in the breast pockets of his shirts. For two years he recorded travels, observations, and meditations on art and life as he moved across America and down to Mexico and back. In 1957, Kerouac sat down with the fifteen handwritten sketch notebooks he had accumulated and typed them into a manuscript called <i>Book of Sketches</i>; he included a handful of new sketches he had written that year. Published now for the first time, and with an introduction by George Condo, <i>Book of Sketches</i> offers an intimate glimpse of Kerouac at a key period of his literary career."

Ray Smith and his friend Japhy, along with Morley the yodeller, head off into the high Sierras to seek the lesson of solitude and experience the Zen way of life. But in wildly bohemian San Francisco, with its poetry jam sessions, marathon drinking bouts and experiments in 'yabyum', they find the ascetic route distinctly hard to follow."
Book of Haikus,,Jack Kerouac,eng,7522,,Enitharmon Press,200,,,,"Renowned for his groundbreaking Beat Generation novel On the Road, Jack Kerouac was also a master of the haiku, the three-line, seventeen-syllable Japanese poetic form. Following in the tradition of Basho, Buson, Shiki, Issa, and other poets, Kerouac experimented with this centuries-old genre, taking it beyond strict syllable counts into what he believed was the form’s essence. He incorporated his ‘American’ haiku in novels and in his correspondence, notebooks, journals, sketchbooks, and recordings. In this edition, Kerouac scholar Regina Weinreich has supplemented a core haiku manuscript from Kerouac’s archives with a generous selection of the rest of his haikus, from both published and unpublished sources. The result is a compact collection of more than five hundred poems that reveal a lesser known but important side of Jack Kerouac’s literary legacy."

In this fine and involving novel Rumer Godden writes of Doone's determination against all odds to become a ballet dancer -- a magical tale of fire and spirit.<br /><br />Doone's difficulties begin at home, for it is actually his pretty, talented, and spoiled sister, Crystal, on whom Ma, a onetime chorus girl, has set all her hopes and dreams of ballet glory, and on whom lessons are lavished by this family of very modest means. When Doone at the age of eight carries Crystal's shoes to her class and first hears, sees, and accidentally participates in dance, he is struck as if by a sorcerer's spell. But far from encouraging him, his parents are appalled -- his mother because Crystal is all, and his father, of course, because ballet is ""sissy."" And adding to the chorus of contempt are four bullying older brothers. <br /><br />Fiercely, Doone follows unbidden in Crystal's wake as they move from faded but loving Madame Tamara's local classes all the way to the undreamed-of heights of the Ballet School at Queen's Chase."

But when she is struck down by a sudden illness and hospitalized, the siblings are left to fend for themselves at the lovely, bullet-scarred hotel Les Oeillets, under the suspicious, watchful eyes of its owner, Mademoiselle Zizi.<br />  <br /> The young ones find a willing guide, companion, and protector in charming Englishman Eliot, a longtime resident at Les Oeillets and Mlle. Zizi’s apparent paramour. But as these warm days of freedom, discovery, and adolescent adventure unfold, Eliot’s interest becomes more and more focused on the eldest of the Grey children, sixteen-year-old daughter Joss. The older man’s obsession with the innocent, alluring, heartbreakingly beautiful woman-child soon threatens to overstep all bounds of propriety. And as Eliot’s fascination increases, so does the jealousy of his disrespected lover, adding fuel to a dangerously smoldering fire that could erupt into unexpected violence at any moment.<br />  <br /> Told from the point of view of Cecil, Joss’s sharp-eyed younger sister, <i>The Greengage Summer </i>is a beautiful, poignant, darkly tinged coming-of-age story rich in the sights, smells, and sounds of France’s breathtaking Champagne country.

Rumer Godden,,Anne Chisholm,eng,1148932,,Pan,335,,,,"A biography of Rumer Godden. Born in India, at the height of British colonial power, she lived there until the 1950s. Her career as a novelist began with ""Black Narcissus"", which became a bestseller on publication in 1939 - and like many of her novels - was adapted into a film. Her relationship with India, although passionate, was ultimately and perhaps inevitably ambivalent and this ambivalence came to a head in an incident when she and her children were living in Kashmir. A servant tried to poison them and the notoriety surrounding the case forced Godden to leave Kashmir and eventually India itself. Her move from India to Scotland contains parallel themes and adventures akin to themes within her novels.<br /><br />Kirkus Reviews:<br />The first half of Rumer Godden's 90 years were spent in India and many of her books are based on her experiences there. They have been likened to Paul Scott's Jewel in the Crown for the light they throw on the last years of the Raj. She was no conventional English rose and shocked society by starting her own dancing school in Calcutta, accepting European pupils and later, leaving her feckless husband to live alone with his two daughters in the hills. Her novel The River, made into a film by Jean Renoir, mirrors her idyllic childhood. Black Narcissus, which made her famous, shows English nuns near Darjeeling struggling, as she did, to understand intractable Indian traditions and King Fishers Catch Fire is the story of a horrific event in her own life when a Kashmiri cook put ground glass into the family's food. This event drove her home to England where she divorced and later became a Catholic (the background to The House of Brede). Basing her biography on talks with Godden, letters and interviews, Anne Chisholm has given us a book that is as compulsively readable as the work of her complex and vivid subject. (Kirkus UK)<br /><br />Although Godden spent much of her life in exotic climes and has proven to be one of the few truly successful ""crossover"" writers, this sprawling biography will neither draw nor hold the attention of readers. Chisholm pads a narrative already filled with eye-glazing details of decades of comings and goings, minor meetings, and social events by taking side excursions to describe the making of films and other tangential episodes; she pays scant attention to Godden's children's books, and never considers how or why the author wrote for that audience. Published in England in 1998, this doesn't cover Godden's last months (she died near the end of the year). It's a mountain of undigested information, richer in itinerary than insight.

Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With <i>The Corrections</i>, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.<br /><br />Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.<br /><br />Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a ""transgressive"" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.<br /><br />Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.<br /></div>"

Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle,,Henri Blocher,eng,7561,,IVP Academic,158,124711,New Studies in Biblical Theology,5,"We live in a world shot through with evil. The twentieth century has witnessed suffering and human cruelty on a scale never before imagined. Yet, paradoxically, in recent years the doctrine of original sin has suffered neglect and ridicule. In this philosophically sophisticated treatment of the biblical evidence for original sin, Henri Blocher offers a robust response. Interacting with the best theological thinking on the subject, this New Studies in Biblical Theology volume shows that while the nature of original sin is a mystery--even a riddle--only belief in it makes sense of evil and wrongdoing. After a general survey of the biblical evidence, Blocher moves on to discuss the two key texts. First, he considers the relation of the Eden story of Genesis 2 and 3 to modern scientific, literary and theological thinking. Then, he offers a new and groundbreaking interpretation of Romans 5, where Paul discusses Christ and Adam. From this exegetical foundation, he goes on to show how the doctrine of original sin makes sense of the paradoxes of human existence. In the final chapter, he discusses the intellectual difficulties that some feel remain with the doctrine itself. Addressing key issues in biblical theology, the works comprising New Studies in Biblical Theology are creative attempts to help Christians better understand their Bibles. The NSBT series is edited by D. A. Carson, aiming to simultaneously instruct and to edify, to interact with current scholarship and to point the way ahead"

A Fairy Tale Created Original Sin,,Reginald Ernest Nixon,,7564,,Creative Responsibility Pty Ltd,194,,,,"Christians are taught to believe that creation and original sin in Genesis actually occurred. They must believe that God created a tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a talking serpent capable of beguiling Eve, and magic fruit that made Adam and Eve aware that they are naked. And, as if by magic, this became original sin and we are all guilty. God cannot forgive until he receives a human sacrifice. This book supplies the evidence to confirm that an ancient fairy tale created original sin. The book questions claims made by organized religions, the existence of the soul and the benefit of prayer. The book asks and investigates: """"If original sin is a fairy tale what other claims made by organized religion may be in doubt? This book rejects fairy tales but not the existence of God."

Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago,,Eric Klinenberg,eng,7582,,University Of Chicago Press,320,,,,"On Thursday, July 13, 1995, Chicagoans awoke to a blistering day in which the temperature would reach 106 degrees. The heat index, which measures how the temperature actually feels on the body, would hit 126 degrees by the time the day was over. Meteorologists had been warning residents about a two-day heat wave, but these temperatures did not end that soon. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; the records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. And by July 20, over seven hundred people had perished-more than twice the number that died in the Chicago Fire of 1871, twenty times the number of those struck by Hurricane Andrew in 1992—in the great Chicago heat wave, one of the deadliest in American history.<br /><br />Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In <i>Heat Wave</i>, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a ""social autopsy,"" examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been.<br /><br />Starting with the question of why so many people died at home alone, Klinenberg investigates why some neighborhoods experienced greater mortality than others, how the city government responded to the crisis, and how journalists, scientists, and public officials reported on and explained these events. Through a combination of years of fieldwork, extensive interviews, and archival research, Klinenberg uncovers how a number of surprising and unsettling forms of social breakdown—including the literal and social isolation of seniors, the institutional abandonment of poor neighborhoods, and the retrenchment of public assistance programs—contributed to the high fatality rates. The human catastrophe, he argues, cannot simply be blamed on the failures of any particular individuals or organizations. For when hundreds of people die behind locked doors and sealed windows, out of contact with friends, family, community groups, and public agencies, everyone is implicated in their demise.<br /><br />As Klinenberg demonstrates in this incisive and gripping account of the contemporary urban condition, the widening cracks in the social foundations of American cities that the 1995 Chicago heat wave made visible have by no means subsided as the temperatures returned to normal. The forces that affected Chicago so disastrously remain in play in America's cities, and we ignore them at our peril."

But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected.

A History of the World in 6 Glasses,,Tom Standage,eng,7600,,Bloomsbury,336,,,,"Throughout human history, certain drinks have done much more than just quench thirst. As Tom Standage relates with authority and charm, six of them have had a surprisingly pervasive influence on the course of history, becoming the defining drink during a pivotal historical period. <br /><br /><i>A History of the World in 6 Glasses</i> tells the story of humanity from the Stone Age to the 21st century through the lens of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and cola. Beer was first made in the Fertile Crescent and by 3000 B.C.E. was so important to Mesopotamia and Egypt that it was used to pay wages. In ancient Greece wine became the main export of her vast seaborne trade, helping spread Greek culture abroad. Spirits such as brandy and rum fueled the Age of Exploration, fortifying seamen on long voyages and oiling the pernicious slave trade. Although coffee originated in the Arab world, it stoked revolutionary thought in Europe during the Age of Reason, when coffeehouses became centers of intellectual exchange. And hundreds of years after the Chinese began drinking tea, it became especially popular in Britain, with far-reaching effects on British foreign policy. Finally, though carbonated drinks were invented in 18th-century Europe they became a 20th-century phenomenon, and Coca-Cola in particular is the leading symbol of globalization.<br /><br />For Tom Standage, each drink is a kind of technology, a catalyst for advancing culture by which he demonstrates the intricate interplay of different civilizations. You may never look at your favorite drink the same way again.<br />"

Like all beloved historians, Armstrong entertains us with deft storytelling, astounding research, and makes us feel a greater appreciation for the present because we better understand our past. Be warned: <i>A History of God</i> is not a tidy linear history. Rather, we learn that the definition of God is constantly being repeated, altered, discarded, and resurrected through the ages, responding to its followers' practical concerns rather than to mystical mandates. Armstrong also shows us how Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have overlapped and influenced one another, gently challenging the secularist history of each of these religions. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"

Into A Paris Quartier: Reine Margot's Chapel and Other Haunts of St.-Germain,,Diane Johnson,eng,7624,,National Geographic,204,,,,"As a child, Diane Johnson was entranced by <i>The Three Musketeers, </i> dashing 17th-century residents of the famous romantic quartier called St.-Germain-des-Pr�s. Now, the paperback edition of her delightful book will take even more Americans to the richly historic part of the city that has always attracted us, from Ben Franklin in the 18th-century to raffish novelist Henry Miller in the 20th.<br /><br />Modern St.-Germain is lively and prosperous, and fifty years ago its heady mix of jazz and existentialism defined urbane cool, but Johnson takes a longer view. ""Beside the shades of Jean-Paul Sartre and Edith Piaf,"" she writes, ""there is another crowd of resident ghosts... misty figures in plumed hats whose fortunes and passions were enacted among these beautiful, imposing buildings."" From her kitchen window, she looks out on a chapel begun by Reine Margot, wife of Henri IV; nearby streets are haunted by the shades of two sinister cardinals, Mazarin and Richelieu, as well as four famed queens and at least five kings. Delacroix, Corot, Ingres, David, and Manet all lived in St.-Germain; Oscar Wilde died there; and everybody who was anybody visited sooner or later.<br /><br />With her delicious imagination and wry, opinionated voice, Diane Johnson makes a companionable and fascinating guide to a classic neighborhood as cosmopolitan as it is quintessentially French."

Much to her surprise, she finds herself drawn to the life she encounters in Iran; intoxicated by each exotic sight which reminds her how far from home she really is; both comforted and unsettled by the group of foreign and Iranian physicians and their wives who take her in. However, her exhilaration crashes when her rooms are searched, and odd, often frightening events begin to occur, exposing the darker side of this ""colonial life."" <b>Persian Nights</b> follows Chloe on a voyage through the seductively inexplicable, and has all the qualities one expects from the gifted author of <b>Le Divorce</b>—the quirky, vivid atmosphere; the intelligent, humane voice; the compelling narrative.

Sur Hypérion, 274 ans après la rupture entre la civilisation humaine et les Intelligences Artificielles, une petite fille, Enée, surgit du labyrinthe du Sphinx. Elle est porteuse d'une prophétie qui en fait un enjeu de pouvoir. Fille de Keats, le cybride issu des Machines, et de l'humaine Brawne Lamia, elle serait, aux yeux de l'Eglise devenue toute-puissante, une créature des machines, et doit être neutralisée. Mais pour Martin Silenus, le très vieux poète des Cantos et l'un des héros d'Hypérion, Enée doit sauver l'humanité et retrouver la Vieille Terre. Silenus charge donc Raul Endymion de l'enlever, au nez et à la barbe de la redoutable Garde Vaticane, vers une destination mystérieuse. Contre toute attente, il réussit. Sur l'ancien navire interstellaire du Consul, Enée, Endymion et l'androïde, A. Bettik, fuient le capitaine de Soya lancé à leurs trousses.

As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.<br /><br />When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape."

Fortunately back in print after several years during which it was hard to obtain, this rich, bizarre novel practically reeks with atmosphere. The story concerns an American poet who travels with his Indian wife and their baby to Calcutta to pick up an epic poem cycle about the goddess Kali. The Bengali poet who wrote the poem cycle has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.<p>Horror critic Edward Bryant calls <i>Song of Kali</i> ""an exactingly constructed, brutal, and uncompromising study of the degree to which an evil place may permeate and steep all that makes us human"" and writes that it embodies ""the stance of a psychologically violent novel about a violent society as a defensible and indisputably moral work of art."" <i>Song of Kali</i> won a World Fantasy Award. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>"

The clarity, knowledge and insight of Edward Norman's chronological survey are supported and enhanced by a brilliantly researched collection of illustrations and photographs. The result is a perfect mix between the most-loved master buildings - from Hagia Sophia to Tokyo Cathedral - and the freshness of the less familiar - a mission church in Paraguay, a Baroque shrine in Goa.

House of Many Gods,,Kiana Davenport,,7722,,Ballantine Books,352,,,,"From Kiana Davenport, the bestselling author of Song of the Exile and Shark Dialogues, comes another mesmerizing novel about her people and her islands. Told in spellbinding and mythic prose, House of Many Gods is a deeply complex and provocative love story set against the background of Hawaii and Russia. Interwoven throughout with the indelible portrait of a native Hawaiian family struggling against poverty, drug wars, and the increasing military occupation of their sacred lands. <br /><br />Progressing from the 1960s to the turbulent present, the novel begins on the island of O’ahu and centers on Ana, abandoned by her mother as a child. Raised by her extended family on the “lawless” Wai’anae coast, west of Honolulu, Ana, against all odds, becomes a physician. While tending victims of Hurricane ‘Iniki on the neighboring island of Kaua’i, she meets Nikolai, a Russian filmmaker with a violent and tragic past, who can confront reality only through his unique prism of lies. Yet he is dedicated to recording the ecological horrors in his motherland and across the Pacific. <br /><br />As their lives slowly and inextricably intertwine, Ana and Nikolai’s story becomes an odyssey that spans decades and sweeps the reader from rural Hawaii to the forbidding Arctic wastes of Russia; from the poverty-stricken Wai’anae coast to the glittering harshness of “new Moscow” and the haunting, faded beauty of St. Petersburg. With stunning narrative inventiveness, Davenport has created a timeless epic of loss and remembrance, of the search for family and identity, and, ultimately, of the redemptive power of love."

Y lo cierto es que había razón para tanta polémica, pues esta novela de Bret Easton Ellis constituye una de las críticas más feroces que un escritor norteamericano ha hecho a su propio país: una sociedad autocomplaciente y orgullosa de sí misma. Para su denuncia, el autor ha escogido un camino arriesgado: Patrick Bateman, el protagonista de <i>American Psycho</i>, no es un rebelde ni un paria; Patrick es un joven de éxito que, sin embargo, también es capaz de violar, torturar y asesinar."
American Psycho,,Bret Easton Ellis,eng,2270060,,Picador,399,,,,"Brett Easton Ellis established a reputation as the <i>enfant terrible</i> of American fiction in the 1980s with his controversial novel <i>Less than Zero</i>, but with the publication of <i>American Psycho</i> he became established as one of the most notorious and reviled novelists currently writing. <i>American Psycho</i> deserves its controversy. The novel opens with a sign scrawled above a New York subway station: ""Abandon hope all ye who enter"". So begins a hellish descent into the world of Patrick Bateman, the novel's protagonist. Bateman is a handsome 26-year-old Wall Street yuppie, who spends his days listening to Whitney Houston and working out which exclusive restaurant to eat in and what clothes to wear in a dizzying parody of 1980s consumerism run mad.<p> However, Bateman also has a darker side; he is a psychopathic serial killer, with a penchant for torturing and sexually abusing young women before killing them in the most gruesome and explicit fashion. The novel contains little actual plot, and consists of extended descriptions of exclusive restaurants, designer clothes, TV shows and the minutiae of Bateman's vacuous world, relieved only by clinically described scenes of torture and mutilation which are not for the faint-hearted. Bateman makes little attempt to justify his actions, merely claiming that ""this is the way the world--my world--moves"". As a satire on the bankrupt, money-driven world of the 1980s, <i>American Psycho</i> is a successful, if rather heavy-handed piece of fiction, whose controversy seems only set to increase. --<i>Jerry Brotton</i></p>"

Lunar Park es una obra excepcional en la que se confunden realidad y ficción, y en ella el enfant terrible de la literatura americana arremete contra su propia biografía."

Life After Death: The Burden of Proof,,Deepak Chopra,eng,21421934,,Harmony,304,,,,"Dr Deepak Chopra, the world-famous pioneer in the field of mind-body medicine, addresses one of the fundamental questions of existence: what happens when we die? Drawing upon personal experience, the wisdom of ancient Vedic philosophy and state-of-the-art particle physics, Chopra helps us to overcome our fears about dying and to consider the fantastic possibilities that may await us in the afterlife.<br /><br />This is the book that Dr Chopra has been preparing to write his entire life.

Burden Of Proof And Related Issues: A Study On Evidence Before International Tribunals,,Mojtaba Kazazi,,7752,,Brill - Nijhoff,408,,,,"This study on evidence before international tribunals, with an emphasis on the burden of proof, is one of the more important and interesting issues of evidence under both municipal and international law. The study is mainly based on documented cases and special attention is paid to the case law of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the Hague. <br />The study is divided into three parts. Part One presents the preliminary issues concerning the concept of the burden of proof and the burden of evidence, as well as the nature and scope of the burden of proof. Part Two discusses the main aspects of the burden of proof, identified by considering the fact that there are three main actors in each litigated case, viz. the claimant, the respondent and the judge or arbitrator. Different chapters are allocated to: the claimant's role in bearing the main task with respect to the burden of proof; general aspects of collaboration of parties in matters of evidence; and the authority and duties of international tribunals with respect to the burden of proof. Part Two ends with a chapter on the rules of the burden of proof and a discussion on whether or not there are any such rules that could be considered as principles of international law. Some related issues are discussed in Part Three. Among the items considered are presumptions and the effect that they may have on the burden of proof; practical aspects of the collaboration of parties; the issue of possible sanctions against non-production of evidence; and the question of the standard of proof to be applied in international proceedings and the discretion of international tribunals in that regard. The study ends with a concluding chapter. <br />As noted by Professor Verhoeven in his foreword, the subtleties of evidence in international proceedings has not been systematically studied for a number of decades. The book will become a standard work of reference in the area. <br /><i>Audience: </i> An invaluable tool for practitioners of international law and Government advisors as well as university professors and students of law. <br /><br />The long experience of the author as a judge in a civil law system, his intimate knowledge of the work of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, and currently with the United Nations (Security Council) Compensation Commission for Claims against Iraq have made him eminently well equipped to address the subject competently, both from a theoretical and practical perspective."
Godless: The Church of Liberalism,,Ann Coulter,eng,621243,,Crown Forum,310,,,,"""If a martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation's official state religion, he would have to conclude it is liberalism, while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law. <br />Many Americans are outraged by liberal hostility to traditional religion. But as Ann Coulter reveals in this, her most explosive book yet, to focus solely on the Left's attacks on our Judeo-Christian tradition is to miss a larger point: liberalism ""is"" a religion--a godless one. <br />And it is now entrenched as the state religion of this county. <br />Though liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, it bears all the attributes of a religion. In ""Godless,"" Coulter throws open the doors of the Church of Liberalism, showing us its sacraments (abortion), its holy writ (""Roe v. Wade""), its martyrs (from Soviet spy Alger Hiss to cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal), its clergy (public school teachers), its churches (government schools, where prayer is prohibited but condoms are free), its doctrine of infallibility (as manifest in the ""absolute moral authority"" of spokesmen from Cindy Sheehan to Max Cleland), and its cosmology (in which mankind is an inconsequential accident). <br />Then, of course, there's the liberal creation myth: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. <br />For liberals, evolution is the touchstone that separates the enlightened from the benighted. But Coulter neatly reverses the pretense that liberals are rationalists guided by the ideals of free inquiry and the scientific method. She exposes the essential truth about Darwinian evolution that liberals refuse to confront: ""it is bogus science."" <br />Writing with a keen appreciation for genuine science, Coulter reveals that the so-called gaps in the theory of evolution are all there is--Darwinism is nothing but a gap. After 150 years of dedicated searching into the fossil record, evolution's proponents have failed utterly to substantiate its claims. And a long line of supposed evidence, from the infamous Piltdown Man to the ""evolving"" peppered moths of England, has been exposed as hoaxes. Still, liberals treat those who question evolution as religious heretics and prohibit students from hearing about real science when it contradicts Darwinism. And these are the people who say they want to keep faith out of the classroom? <br />Liberals' absolute devotion to Darwinism, Coulter shows, has nothing to do with evolution's scientific validity and everything to do with its refusal to admit the possibility of God as a guiding force. They will brook no challenges to the official religion. <br />Fearlessly confronting the high priests of the Church of Liberalism and ringing with Coulter's razor-sharp wit, ""Godless"" is the most important and riveting book yet from one of today's most lively and impassioned conservative voices. ""Liberals love to boast that they are not 'religious, ' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as 'religion.'"" --From Godless"
Godless,,Pete Hautman,eng,963228,,Simon  Schuster Books for Young Readers,208,,,,"""Why mess around with Catholicism when you can have your own customized religion?"" <p> Fed up with his parents' boring old religion, agnostic-going-on-atheist Jason Bock invents a new god -- the town's water tower. He recruits an unlikely group of worshippers: his snail-farming best friend, Shin, cute-as-a-button (whatever that means) Magda Price, and the violent and unpredictable Henry Stagg. As their religion grows, it takes on a life of its own. While Jason struggles to keep the faith pure, Shin obsesses over writing their bible, and the explosive Henry schemes to make the new faith even more exciting -- and dangerous. </p><p> When the Chutengodians hold their first ceremony high atop the dome of the water tower, things quickly go from merely dangerous to terrifying and deadly. Jason soon realizes that inventing a religion is a lot easier than controlling it, but control it he must, before his creation destroys both his friends and himself.</p>"

The authors, both distinguished scholars, revisit the historical roots of American religious freedom, paying particular attention to such figures as John Locke, Roger Williams, and especially Thomas Jefferson, and examine the controversies, up to the present day, over the proper place of religion in our political life.

Norton & Company,,,,,"The Godless Constitution is an urgent and timely reexamination of the roots of church-state separation in American politics - and a ringing refutation of the misguided claims of the religious right. In this important polemic two distinguished scholars of American political ideas and religion refute this dangerous attempt to introduce what they term ""religious correctness"" into our politics, by reminding us that the absence of any mention of God in the Constitution was a conscious action on the framers' part, intended to prevent the bloody religious controversies that so marked European history. They also emphasize that church-state separation was seen as a guarantee of - not a hindrance to - religions liberty. Fully respecting the importance of religion in the public sphere, yet forthright in defining proper limits, The Godless Constitution offers a bracing return to the first principles of American democracy - and a guide to keeping them intact in the forthcoming presidential campaign."
"A Godless Jew: Freud, Atheism, and the Making of Psychoanalysis",,Peter Gay,,7762,,Yale University Press,182,,,,"“Why did none of the devout create psychoanalysis?  Why did it have to wait for a completely godless Jew?” Freud once asked.  In this book, the eminent historian and Freud scholar Peter Gay enters the long-running controversy about the relationship between religion and psychoanalysis.  Gay takes seriously Freud’s claim that he was an atheist and argues that atheism was an essential stance for the making of psychoanalysis.  He contends, in fact, that Judaism was not essential and that psychoanalysis is not a “Jewish science,” as both anti-Semites and ardent Freudians have often assumed.  <br />Peter Gay begins by discussing why psychoanalysis could only have been conceived by an atheist.  According to him, Freud saw science and religion as absolutely at odds with each other.  While some theologians and analysts have attempted to forge an alliance between psychoanalytic and religious positions, these attempts at accommodation have failed and must fail.  Psychoanalysis is not a religion, and the two comprise wholly incompatible styles of thinking about the world.  <br />Gay then deals with the question of whether Freud’s Jewish background contributed to the creation of psychoanalysis and describes Freud’s secular Judaism: while Freud was very much aware of his Jewishness and was in fact proud of it, this had nothing to do with the making of psychoanalysis itself.  True, Freud himself saw a possible link between his Jewishness and his daring: as a Jew he was treated ass an outsider and therefore, he thought, could approach delicate topics such as sexuality more boldly than he would have if he had been thoroughly lodged on the inside.  However, Gay maintains that this is at best a weak statement.<br />Writing with his customary wit and charm, Gay not only discusses Freud’s life and personality as they affected his ideas on religion but also compares Freud’s thoughts on religion to those of William James, Charles Darwin, Paul Tillich, and a host of Enlightenment figures.  The result is a book that will richly reward ever reader.<br />"
Godless Morality,,Richard Holloway,,7759,,Canongate UK,176,,,,"The use of God in moral debate is so problematic as to be almost worthless. We can argue with one another as to whether this or that alleged claim genuinely emanated from God, but surely it is better to leave God out of the argument and find strong human reasons for supporting the systems we advocate. We need a sensible and practical approach that will help us pick our way through the moral maze that confronts us in the pluralistic society we live in. <i>Godless Morality</i> offers exactly this—a human-centered justification for contemporary morality."

Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,,Malcolm Gladwell,eng,1180927,,Penguin,278,,,,"Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? <br /><br />In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. <br /><br />Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way."

Hip-hop culture is shaping the next generation. Ignoring it will not reduce its influence; it will only separate us from the youth moving to its rhythm.

To the thirty-nine-year-old Texas-based senior editor for <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, Cleveland, Ohio, was a million miles away. Dan was the prodigal middle son within a large Irish-Catholic family, and life never really got going until he was far away from the city and his dominant father, Richard. But the gravitational pull of his hometown grew stronger as each year passed by. The final tug home came when the NFL announced that the Cleveland Browns football franchise would be resurrected for the 1999-2000 season. All McGraws and Clevelanders are die-hard Sunday afternoon football fans, and Dan decided to take a leave of absence and cover the Browns' first season. Soon thereafter, Richard was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Dan came home to a press pass and the caretaking chores for a father intent on dying the way he lived, on his own terms.<br /><br /><b>First and Last Seasons</b> is a heart-wrenching work about fathers and sons, the binding influence of community, and how emotionally disconnected men find a common language in sports.

"1939, the Last Season of Peace",,Angela Lambert,,2276535,,George Weidenfeld & Nicholson,235,,,,"First published in 1989, this is an account of the oldest of traditions. It was called the London Season, and for three centuries it had been a time of fashionable suppers and brilliant balls that introduced England's most aristocratic and eligible girls to society. Though by 1939 the stately gavottes and minuets had long since given way to waltzes and fox-trots, the cream of young womanhood still curtsied low before the Queen and then went out to dance the night away with the young men they would one day marry.But the Season of 1939 was different: it was to be the last. And like many a finale, it lives on in memory as a lovely, enchanted dream, all the more beautiful for the horror and destruction that would follow so soon.Based on a wealth of first-hand reminiscences, press clippings, and memorabilia, "" 1939: The Last Season of Peace"" is a fascinating portrait of this fairy tale about to end. It captures the end of an era as it recreates a world whose inhabitants still believed in empire and tradition. It is a vivid picture of a generation suspended in a brief moment of sunlit summer glory, before the gathering storm of World War II swept it all away."

"The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers and Their Final Pennant Race Together",,Michael   Shapiro,,1584066,,Broadway,384,,,,"In the bestselling tradition of <i>The Boys of Summer</i> and <i>Wait ‘Til Next Year</i>, <i>The Last Good Season</i> is the poignant and dramatic story of the Brooklyn Dodgers’ last pennant and the forces that led to their heartbreaking departure to Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 1956 Brooklyn Dodgers were one of baseball’s most storied teams, featuring such immortals as Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, and Roy Campanella. The love between team and borough was equally storied, an iron bond of loyalty forged through years of adversity and sometimes legendary ineptitude. Coming off their first World Series triumph ever in 1955, against the hated Yankees, the Dodgers would defend their crown against the Milwaukee Braves and the Cincinnati Reds in a six-month neck-and-neck contest until the last day of the playoffs, one of the most thrilling pennant races in history.<br /><br />But as <i>The Last Good Season</i> so richly relates, all was not well under the surface. The Dodgers were an aging team at the tail end of its greatness, and Brooklyn was a place caught up in rapid and profound urban change. From a cradle of white ethnicity, it was being transformed into a racial patchwork, including Puerto Ricans and blacks from the South who flocked to Ebbets Field to watch the Dodgers’ black stars. The institutions that defined the borough – the Brooklyn Eagle, the Brooklyn Navy Yard – had vanished, and only the Dodgers remained. And when their shrewd, dollar-squeezing owner, Walter O’Malley, began casting his eyes elsewhere in the absence of any viable plan to replace the aging Ebbets Field and any support from the all-powerful urban czar Robert Moses, the days of the Dodgers in Brooklyn were clearly numbered.<br /><br />Michael Shapiro, a Brooklyn native, has interviewed many of the surviving participants and observers of the 1956 season, and undertaken immense archival research to bring its public and hidden drama to life. Like David Halberstam’s <i>The Summer of ’49</i>, <i>The Last Good Season</i> combines an exciting baseball story, a genuine sense of nostalgia, and hard-nosed reporting and social thinking to reveal, in a new light, a time and place we only thought we understood.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

The Cold Six Thousand (Underworld USA #2),,James Ellroy,eng,22797,,Vintage,688,56670,Underworld USA,2,"In this savagely audacious novel, James Ellroy<i> </i>plants a pipe bomb under the America in the 1960s, lights the fuse, and watches the shrapnel fly. On November 22, 1963 three men converge in Dallas. Their job: to clean up the JFK hit’s loose ends and inconvenient witnesses. They are Wayne Tedrow, Jr., a Las Vegas cop with family ties to the lunatic right; Ward J. Littell, a defrocked FBI man turned underworld mouthpiece; and Pete Bondurant, a dope-runner and hit-man who serves as the mob’s emissary to the anti-Castro underground.<br /><br />It goes bad from there. For the next five years these night-riders run a whirlwind of plots and counter-plots: Howard Hughes’s takeover of Vegas, J. Edgar Hoover’s war against the civil rights movement, the heroin trade in Vietnam, and the murders of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy. Wilder than <i>L. A. Confidential, </i>more devastating than <i>American Tabloid, </i><b>The Cold Six Thousand </b>establishes Ellroy as one of our most fearless novelists."
The Cold Six Thousand,,James Ellroy,,22797,,,,56670,Underworld USA,2,"With its hypnotic, staccato rhythms, and words jostling, bumping, marching forward with edgy intensity (like lemmings heading toward a cliff of their own devising), <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i> feels as if it's being narrated by a hopped-up Dr. Seuss who's hungrier for violence than for green eggs and ham. In spinning the threads of post-JFK-assassination cultural chaos, James Ellroy's whirlwind riff on the 1960s takes nothing for granted, except that absolute power corrupts absolutely. <p> Hurtling from Las Vegas to Vietnam to Cuba to Memphis and back again (and all points in between), from Dealey Plaza to opium fields to smoke-filled back rooms where the mob holds sway, the novel traces the strands of complicity, greed, and fear that connect three men to a legion of supporting characters: Ward Littell, a former Feeb whose current allegiance to the mob and to Howard Hughes can't mask his admiration for the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King; Pete Bondurant, a hit man and fervent anti-Communist who splits his time between Vegas casinos and CIA-sponsored heroin labs in Saigon; and Wayne Tedrow Jr., a young Vegas cop who's sent to Dallas in late November 1963 to snuff a black pimp, and who is fighting a losing battle against his predilection for violence: ""Junior was a hider. Junior was a watcher. Junior lit flames. Junior torched. Junior lived in his head."" </p><p> And behind these three, J. Edgar Hoover is the master puppeteer, pulling strings with visionary zeal and resolute pragmatism, the still point around whom the novel roils and tumbles. At once evil and comic, Hoover predicts that LBJ ""will deplete his prestige on the home front and recoup it in Vietnam. History will judge him as a tall man with big ears who needed wretched people to love him,"" and feels that Cuba ""appeals to hotheads and the morally impaired. It's the cuisine and the sex. Plantains and women who have intercourse with donkeys.""</p><p> The Seussian comparison isn't that far-fetched: Ellroy's novel, like the children's books (and like the very decade it limns), is flexible, spontaneous, and unabashedly off-kilter. Weighing in at a hefty 700 pages, <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i> is a trifle bloated by the excesses of its narrative form.	But what glorious excess it is, as Ellroy continues to illuminate the twin impulses toward idealism and corruption that frame American popular and political culture. He deftly puts unforgettable faces and voices to the murkiest of conspiracy theories, and simultaneously mocks our eager assumption that such knowledge will make a difference. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"
Poems,,Hermann Hesse,,1732757,,Farrar Straus Giroux,96,,,,"Few American readers seem to be aware that Hermann Hesse, author of the epic novels <i>Steppenwolf</i> and <i>Siddhartha</i>, among many others, also wrote poetry, the best of which the poet James Wright has translated and included in this book. This is a special volume—filled with short, direct poems about love, death, loneliness, the seasons—that is imbued with some of the imagery and feeling of Hesse’s novels but that has a clarity and resonance all its own, a sense of longing for love and for home that is both deceptively simple and deeply moving."
Journey To The East,,Hermann Hesse,en-GB,1528180,,Pilgrims Publishing,175,,,,"In simple, mesmerizing prose, Hermann Hesse's <i>Journey to the East</i> tells of a journey both geographic and spiritual. H.H., a German choirmaster, is invited on an expedition with the League, a secret society whose members include Paul Klee, Mozart, and Albertus Magnus. The participants traverse both space and time, encountering Noah's Ark in Zurich and Don Quixote at Bremgarten. The pilgrims' ultimate destination is the East, the ""Home of the Light,"" where they expect to find spiritual renewal. Yet the harmony that ruled at the outset of the trip soon degenerates into an opening conflict. Each traveler finds the rest of the group intolerable and heads off in his own direction, with H.H. bitterly blaming the others for the failure of the journey. It is only long after the trip, while poring over records in the League archives, that H.H. discovers his own role in the dissolution of the group, and the ominous significance of the journey itself."
Narcissus and Goldmund,,Hermann Hesse,,955995,,Bantam Books (NY),312,,,,"Narcissus &amp; Goldmund is a novel written by the German Swiss author Hermann Hesse first published as Narziß und Goldmund in 1930. At the time it was considered his literary triumph. Bibliographically, it follows Der Steppenwolf.<br /> Narcissus &amp; Goldmund tells of a young man, Goldmund, who wanders throughout Medieval Germany upon leaving Catholic monastery school in search of the meaning of life &amp;, thus, meaning for his life. Narcissus, a gifted young teacher at the cloister school, befriends him, as they are only a few years apart &amp; Goldmund is very bright. Goldmund admires Narcissus, &amp; Narcissus has much fondness for him in return. After straying too far in the fields one day on an errand gathering herbs, Goldmund comes across a beautiful woman, who kisses him &amp; invites him to make love. This encounter is an epiphany. He realizes he was never meant to be a monk. He's filled with the desire to experience everything, learn about life &amp; nature in his own hands-on way. With Narcissus' support, he leaves the monastery &amp; wanders around the countryside, setting the scene for a story contrasting the artist with the thinker. It spans many years, detailing specific incidents where Goldmund learns important things. He often muses on these experiences &amp; the ways of life.<br /> The influence of Nietzsche's theory of the Apollonian versus Dionysian spirit is evident. The polarization of Narcissus's individualist Apollonian character is contrasted to the passionately zealous disposition of Goldmund. In the spirit of The Birth of Tragedy, Hesse completes the equation by creating Goldmund as an Apollonian artist, highlighting the harmonizing relationship of the main characters.<br /> Goldmund develops into a completely rounded character as he comes to embody both Apollonian &amp; Dionysian elements, thus capturing Nietzsche's conception of the ideal tragedy. He embodies the entire spectrum of experience, lusting for the gruesome ecstasy of the Dionysian world yet capturing &amp; representing it thru artistic creativity.<br /> Like most of Hesse's works, the main themes are the struggle between human being &amp; nature &amp; the union of polar opposites. Goldmund represents art &amp; nature, the feminine mind, while Narcissus represents science, logic, god &amp; the masculine mind. These feminine &amp; masculine qualities are drawn from Jungian archetypal theory, &amp; are reminiscent of some of his earlier works, especially Demian. Throughout the novel, Goldmund increasingly becomes aware of memories of his own mother, which ultimately results in his desire to return to the Urmutter."
Siddhartha,,Hermann Hesse,,4840290,,Kessinger Publishing,96,,,,"Siddhartha (1922) by Hermann Hesse is a deceptively simple, intense, and lyrical allegorical tale of a man in ancient India striving for enlightenment at the time of Buddha.

To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House calls upon the skills of intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic scholar Michael Tolland, Rachel travels to the Arctic and uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery -- a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy. But before she can warn the President, Rachel and Michael are ambushed by a deadly team of assassins.

But recently it has become apparent that the majority of those inside ""the Craft"" are just as much in the dark about the secrets they are supposedly sworn to guard. So what is the source of these secrets—and what is their purpose? <p>In this eye-opening account, two seasoned researchers show that today's Freemasons are the spiritual descendents of an ancient priesthood that was forced to act in secrecy. They predicted the birth of the coming Messiah, and Jesus Christ was part of their mission. Soon after the Crucifixion they were nearly wiped out by a program of mass genocide conducted by the Romans; later, in feudal Europe, they grew to a position of unparalleled power before being branded as heretics and forced underground. But they could not be stopped, and they continued to work in subtle, sometimes subversive, always anonymous, ways to pursue their objective - a new world order that put God above, and yet out of, human affairs.</p>"

New England the Bavarian Illuminati is the history of the Illuminati scare that occurred in America at the end of the eighteenth century. It tells how the Federalists, including the New England clergy in particular, seized upon the idea that the Illuminati were behind the actions of the Democrats. Only a far-reaching conspiracy could explain the irreverent habits and searing attacks of the Jeffersonians. Fear of the secret Democratic Clubs, magnified by fear of the French Jacobins, made such a conspiracy readily believable. Dr. Stauffer ably details the state of American politics and religion before and after the American Revolution. He recounts the known history of the Illuminati, and reviews how knowledge of the secret organization was transmitted to America. The conspiracy alarm is traced in detail, from the first announcement of the existence of the Illuminati given during a sermon, through the heated and virulent debates in newspapers and pamphlets, and finally to the decline of the public spectacle under counter-attacks and satirical mockery. This study of the Illuminati in New England was originally published in 1918. Acclaimed from its first printing, it has since then developed a respectable position as one of the most competent and important histories on the shadowy Order of the Illuminati."

Especially poignant is his reaction to ""A Minor Incident,"" a Badly Drawn Boy song written for the soundtrack of the film version of Hornby's book <i>About a Boy</i>. While Hornby was writing the book, his young son was diagnosed with autism--a fact that adds greater resonance to the seemingly unrelated song he hears much later: ""I write a book that isn't about my kid, and then someone writes a beautiful song based on an episode in my book that turns out to mean something much more personal to me than my book ever did.""

Overall, Hornby's pitch-perfect prose, the quirky illustrations from Canadian artist Marcel Dzama, and a good cause--proceeds benefit TreeHouse, a U.K. charity for children with autism, and 826 Valencia, the nonprofit Bay Area learning center--add up to make <i>Songbook</i> a hit.

High Fidelity,,Nick Hornby,en-US,2961887,,Riverhead Books,323,,,,"It has been said often enough that baby boomers are a television generation, but the very funny novel <i>High Fidelity</i> reminds that in a way they are the record-album generation as well. This funny novel is obsessed with music; Hornby's narrator is an early-thirtysomething English guy who runs a London record store. He sells albums recorded the old-fashioned way--on vinyl--and is having a tough time making other transitions as well, specifically adulthood. The book is in one sense a love story, both sweet and interesting; most entertaining, though, are the hilarious arguments over arcane matters of pop music."
How to Be Good,,Nick Hornby,,2961919,,,305,,,,"In Nick Hornby's <i>How to Be Good</i>, Katie Carr is certainly <i>trying</i> to be. That's why she became a GP. That's why she cares about Third World debt and homelessness, and struggles to raise her children with a conscience. It's also why she puts up with her husband David, the self-styled Angriest Man in Holloway. But one fateful day, she finds herself in a Leeds parking lot, having just slept with another man. What Katie doesn't yet realize is that her fall from grace is just the first step on a spiritual journey more torturous than the interstate at rush hour. Because, prompted by his wife's actions, David is about to stop being angry. He's about to become good--not politically correct, organic-food-eating good, but good in the fashion of the Gospels. And that's no easier in modern-day Holloway than it was in ancient Israel. <p> Hornby means us to take his title literally: How can we be good, and what does that mean? However, quite apart from demanding that his readers scrub their souls with the nearest available Brillo pad, he also mesmerizes us with that cocktail of wit and compassion that has become his trademark. The result is a multifaceted jewel of a book: a hilarious romp, a painstaking dissection of middle-class mores, and a powerfully sympathetic portrait of a marriage in its death throes. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry as we watch David forcing his kids to give away their computers, drawing up schemes for the mass redistribution of wealth, and inviting his wife's most desolate patients round for a Sunday roast. But that's because <i>How to Be Good</i> manages to be both brutally truthful and full of hope. It won't outsell the Bible, but it's a lot funnier. <i>--Matthew Baylis</i><br /><br /><br />From <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br />Kate, a doctor, wife and mother, is in the midst of a difficult decision: whether to leave or stay with her bitter, sarcastic husband David (who proudly writes a local newspaper column called ""The Angriest Man in Holloway""). The long-term marriage has gone stale, but is it worth uprooting the children and the comfortable lifestyle? Then David meets a faith healer called Dr. Goodnews, and suddenly converts to an idealistic do-gooder: donating the children's computer to an orphanage, giving away the family's Sunday dinner to homeless people and inviting runaways to stay in the guest room (and convincing the neighbors to do likewise). Barber gives an outstanding performance as Kate, humorously conveying her mounting irritation at having her money and belongings donated to strangers, her guilt at not feeling more generous and her hilarious desire for revenge. Barber brilliantly portrays each eccentric character: hippie-ish Goodnews, crusading David, petulant children and, poignantly, the hesitant, halting Barmy Brian, a mentally deficient patient of Kate's who needs looking after. Barber's stellar performance turns a worthy novel into a must-listen event. Simultaneous release with Riverhead hardcover (Forecasts, June 25).</p>"

He begins with Teenage Fanclub's Your Love is the Place that I Come From and ends with Patti Smith's Pissing in a River, encompassing varied singers along the way, such as Van Morrison and Nelly Furtado, and songs as different as Thunder Road and Puff the Magic Dragon (reggae style).

If he occasionally implores a biographer for brevity, or abandons a literary work in favour of an Arsenal match, then all is not lost. His writing, full of all the joy and surprise and despair that books bring him, reveals why we still read, even when there's football on TV, a pram in the hall or a good band playing at our local pub."

  <div>Gaius Petrius Ruso is a divorced and down-on his luck army doctor who has made the rash decision to seek his fortune in an inclement outpost of the Roman Empire, namely Britannia. His arrival in Deva (more commonly known as Chester, England) does little to improve his mood, and after a straight thirty six hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to a moment of weakness and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her abusive owner.<br /> <br />Now he has a new problem: a slave who won't talk and can't cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out of the local bar. A few years earlier, after he rescued Emperor Trajan from an earthquake in Antioch, Ruso seemed headed for glory: now he's living among heathens in a vermin-infested bachelor pad and must summon all his forensic knowledge to find a killer who may be after him next. <br /> <br />Who are the true barbarians, the conquered or the conquerors? It's up to Ruso—certainly the most likeable sleuth to come out of the Roman Empire—to discover the truth. With a gift for comic timing and historic detail, Ruth Downie has conjured an ancient world as raucous and real as our own.</div>

It sees the imagery through the contemporary exegetical writings and tries thus to uncover new strata of symbolic significance in early Christian art. The aim of the work is to reveal the complex theological concepts reflected in the relief decoration of a small number of late fourth-century sarcophagi and to cast thus light upon the spiritual climate of the sphere the persons who commissioned them were part of. It also links the narrative structure of representations of medical treatment and miracle scenes in ancient art with the Christian images and establishes new formal and iconographic connexions.

Located some thirty miles west of New York City, the borough was known for its brilliant and varied gardens, farms, and greenhouses. Orchids and other blooms grown at Thomas Young Orchids and other local greenhouses were distributed in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York and were said to have been favored by Eleanor Roosevelt.Middlesex Borough explores this town's unique history from its incorporation in 1913 to the mid-1900s with vintage photographs and fascinating text. During the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, residents of the westerly portion of Piscataway Township, at the urging of George Harris, decided to secede from Piscataway and form an independent town. The newly created Middlesex Borough consisted of large farms owned by the Stout, Reidy, Conover, Giles, Guernsey, and Harris families, with clusters of small homes bordering them. The Central Railroad of New Jersey passed through the town, bringing new residents to Middlesex from New York City and fostering the development of small factories and workers' houses in the Lincoln section, the housing developments of Pierce Estates and Dewey Park, and, later, the spacious homes and properties in the Beechwood Heights section of the borough."

In this slim debut novel, he tells a coming-of-age tale of a fairly unpleasant young actor from Texas named William who lives in Manhattan and is working his way through an ugly little relationship with a singer/songwriter named Sarah.<br /><br />Player of confused but adorable Gen X Romeos in films like Reality Bites and Before Sunrise, Hawke, 25, is easily conjured up as a stand-in for 21-year-old William Harding, the disaffected narrator of this slim first novel, a boy-meets-girl, girl-dumps-boy saga set in a grungy New York of aspiring actors, writers and singers. <br />That William, a college dropout and budding actor, falls fast and hard for Sarah Wingfield, who fronts a band, teaches preschool and is a bit ""funny looking,"" comes as a revelation to him, given his history of using his good looks for quick sex. Sarah casts William's sexual yearnings and his white trash boyhood into sharp relief by reading Adrienne Rich, toting a list of rape statistics and refusing to sleep with him. Their doomed romance is intercut with William's memories of his parents' breakup, of talks with his best friend and of his overheated teen relationship with Samantha, who still flits in and out of his life. <br />When Sarah suddenly, inexplicably rejects him after William returns from making a movie in Paris, he descends into self-loathing panic and trashes his apartment. His callow cynicism about women and his flattened out, '90s rendition of Holden Caulfield (""Samantha wanted to have sex. She wasn't doing me any goddamn favors"") grow wearisome. But Hawke's emotionally raw account of a world inescapably contracted is oddly affecting and sure to make many a teenage heart go pit-a-pat."

Imbued with an Egyptian sense of humor and deeply rooted in the culture and politics of the modern period, the novel takes a humorous but often black look at the changes that have occurred in Egypt over the past few decades. Zaat's life experiences and relationships are set against economic and social upheavals in a style that is both sophisticated and bawdy, highly ironic and often extremely poignant. Zaat's story is interspersed and illustrated with extracts from newspapers of the day headlines, articles, captions, death notices, advertisements reflecting events and incidents contemporary with her life. Beautifully put together with bitter and cutting irony, they tell of corruption, financial scandals, torture, foreign debt, and social problems. The heroine epitomizes the hopes, dreams, and ambitions of simple folk tossed about on the stormy sea of modernization, consumerism, and the ever-present mirage of new wealth. Zaat is a brilliant social commentary that provides keen insights into how Egypt has come to be the way it is today."

The experience made Faulkner realize that she was not alone—that the country is full of women who are anxious and conflicted about their roles as mothers and wives.<br /><br />In <i>Dispatches from a Not-So-Perfect Life</i>, her provocative, brutally honest, and often hilarious memoir of motherhood, Faulkner explores the causes of her unhappiness, as well as the societal and cultural forces that American mothers have to contend with. From the time of her first pregnancy, Faulkner found herself—and her body—scrutinized by doctors, friends, strangers, and, perhaps most of all, herself. In addition to the significant social pressures of raising the perfect child and being the perfect mom, Faulkner also found herself increasingly incensed by the unequal distribution of household labor and infuriated by the gender inequity in both her home and others’. And though she loves her children and her husband passionately, is thankful for her bountiful middle-class life, and feels wracked with guilt for being unhappy, she just can’t seem to experience the sense of satisfaction that she thought would come with the package. She’s finally got it all—the husband, the house, the kids, an interesting part-time job, even a few hours a week to write—so why does she feel so conflicted?<br /><br />Faulkner sheds light on the fear, confusion, and isolation experienced by many new mothers, mapping the terrain of contemporary domesticity, marriage, and motherhood in a voice that is candid, irreverent, and deeply personal, while always chronicling the unparalleled joy she and other mothers take in their children."

"My War Gone By, I Miss It So",,Anthony Loyd,eng,8029,,Penguin Books (NY),336,,,,"Nothing can prepare you for <b>Anthony Loyd</b>'s portrait of war. It is the story of the unspeakable terror and the visceral, ecstatic thrill of combat, and the lives and dreams laid to waste by the bloodiest conflict that Europe has witnessed since the Second World War. Born into a distinguished military family, Loyd was raised on the stories of his ancestors' exploits and grew up fascinated with war. Unsatisfied by a brief career in the British Army, he set out for the killing fields in Bosnia. It was there--in the midst of the roar of battle and the life-and-death struggle among the Serbs, Croatians, and Bosnian Muslims--that he would discover humanity at its worst and best. Profoundly shocking, poetic, and ultimately redemptive, this is an uncompromising look at the brutality of war and its terrifyingly seductive power."

Maximum Security: The Culture of Violence in Inner-City Schools,,John Devine,,8038,,University of Chicago Press,296,,,,"Escalations in student violence continue throughout the nation, but inner-city schools are the hardest hit, with classrooms and corridors infected by the anger, aggression, and criminality endemic to street life. Technological surveillance, security personnel, and paramilitary control tactics to maintain order and safety are the common administrative response. Essential educational programs are routinely slashed from school budgets, even as the number of guards, cameras, and metal detectors continues to multiply.<br /><br />Based on years of frontline experience in New York's inner-city schools, <i>Maximum Security</i> demonstrates that such policing strategies are not only ineffectual, they divorce students and teachers from their ethical and behavioral responsibilities. Exploring the culture of violence from within, John Devine argues that the security system, with its uniformed officers and invasive high-tech surveillance, has assumed presumptive authority over students' bodies and behavior, negating the traditional roles of teachers as guardians and agents of moral instruction. The teacher is reduced to an information bureaucrat, a purveyor of technical knowledge, while the student's physical well-being and ethical actions are left to the suspect scrutiny of electronic devices and security specialists with no pedagogical mission, training, or interest. The result is not a security system at all, but an insidious institutional disengagement from the caring supervision of the student body.<br /><br />With uncompromising honesty, Devine provides a powerful portrayal of an educational system in crisis and bold new insight into the malignant culture of school violence.<br />"

Now, writing with the same rare grasp and clarity that made their earlier books classics, the Tofflers turn their attention to the revolution in wealth now sweeping the planet. And once again, they provide a penetrating, coherent way to make sense of the seemingly senseless.<br /><br /><i>Revolutionary Wealth</i> is about how tomorrow’s wealth will be created, and who will get it and how. But twenty-first-century wealth, according to the Tofflers, is not just about money, and cannot be understood in terms of industrial-age economics. Thus they write here about everything from education and child rearing to Hollywood and China, from everyday truth and misconceptions to what they call our “third job”—the unnoticed work we do without pay for some of the biggest corporations in our country. <br /><br />They show the hidden connections between extreme sports, chocolate chip cookies, Linux software and the “surplus complexity” in our lives as society wobbles back and forth between depressing decadence and a hopeful post-decadence. <br /><br />In their earlier work, the Tofflers coined the word “prosumer” for people who consume what they themselves produce. In <i>Revolutionary Wealth</i> they expand the concept to reveal how many of our activities—whether parenting or volunteering, blogging, painting our house, improving our diet, organizing a neighborhood council or even “mashing” music—pump “free lunch” from the “hidden” non-money economy into the money economy that economists track. Prosuming, they forecast, is about to explode and compel radical changes in the way we measure, make and manipulate wealth. <br /><br />Blazing with fresh ideas, <i>Revolutionary Wealth</i> provides readers with powerful new tools for thinking about—and preparing for—their future.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

In REVOLUTIONARY WEALTH, they once again demonstrate their unparalleled ability to illuminate current trends and anticipate what they mean for the future.<br /><br />REVOLUTIONARY WEALTH focuses on how wealth will be created--and who will get it--in the twenty-first century. As the knowledge-based economy (a reality the Tofflers predicted forty years ago) continues to replace the industrial-based economy, they argue, money is no longer the sole determinate of wealth. The Tofflers explain that we are becoming a nation of ""prosumers,"" consuming what we ourselves produce, and argue that we have all taken on ""third jobs""--work we unwittingly do without pay for some of the biggest corporations in the country. Using fascinating examples from our daily lives, they illustrate how our everyday activities--from parenting and volunteering to blogging, painting our houses, and improving our diets--contribute to a non-monetary economy that is largely hidden from economists. Writing with the same insight and clarity that made their earlier books bestsellers, the Tofflers present fresh, groundbreaking new ways of thinking about wealth."

American Gods,,Neil Gaiman,eng,1970226,Adobe Acrobat ebook edition,PerfectBound (HarperCollins),635,114135,American Gods,,"<i>American Gods</i> is Neil Gaiman's best and most ambitious novel yet, a scary, strange, and hallucinogenic road-trip story wrapped around a deep examination of the American spirit. Gaiman tackles everything from the onslaught of the information age to the meaning of death, but he doesn't sacrifice the razor-sharp plotting and narrative style he's been delivering since his Sandman days.<p> Shadow gets out of prison early when his wife is killed in a car crash. At a loss, he takes up with a mysterious character called Wednesday, who is much more than he appears. In fact, Wednesday is an old god, once known as Odin the All-father, who is roaming America rounding up his forgotten fellows in preparation for an epic battle against the upstart deities of the Internet, credit cards, television, and all that is wired. Shadow agrees to help Wednesday, and they whirl through a psycho-spiritual storm that becomes all too real in its manifestations. For instance, Shadow's dead wife Laura keeps showing up, and not just as a ghost--the difficulty of their continuing relationship is by turns grim and darkly funny, just like the rest of the book. </p><p> Armed only with some coin tricks and a sense of purpose, Shadow travels through, around, and underneath the visible surface of things, digging up all the powerful myths Americans brought with them in their journeys to this land as well as the ones that were already here. Shadow's road story is the heart of the novel, and it's here that Gaiman offers up the details that make this such a cinematic book--the distinctly American foods and diversions, the bizarre roadside attractions, the decrepit gods reduced to shell games and prostitution. ""This is a bad land for Gods,"" says Shadow.</p><p> More than a tourist in America, but not a native, Neil Gaiman offers an outside-in and inside-out perspective on the soul and spirituality of the country--our obsessions with money and power, our jumbled religious heritage and its societal outcomes, and the millennial decisions we face about what's real and what's not. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"
"American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation",,Jon Meacham,eng,803611,,Random House (NY),399,,,,"The American Gospel-literally, the good news about America-is that religion shapes our public life without controlling it. In this vivid book, New York Times bestselling author Jon Meacham tells the human story of how the Founding Fathers viewed faith, and how they ultimately created a nation in which belief in God is a matter of choice. <br />At a time when our country seems divided by extremism, American Gospel draws on the past to offer a new perspective. Meacham re-creates the fascinating history of a nation grappling with religion and politics-from John Winthrop's ""city on a hill"" sermon to Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence; from the Revolution to the Civil War; from a proposed nineteenth-century Christian Amendment to the Constitution to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call for civil rights; from George Washington to Ronald Reagan. <br />Debates about religion and politics are often more divisive than illuminating. Secularists point to a ""wall of separation between church and state,"" while many conservatives act as though the Founding Fathers were apostles in knee britches. As Meacham shows in this brisk narrative, neither extreme has it right. At the heart of the American experiment lies the God of what Benjamin Franklin called ""public religion,"" a God who invests all human beings with inalienable rights while protecting private religion from government interference. It is a great American balancing act, and it has served us well. <br />Meacham has written and spoken extensively about religion and politics, and he brings historical authority and a sense of hope to the issue. American Gospel makes it compellingly clear that the nation's best chance of summoning what Lincolncalled ""the better angels of our nature"" lies in recovering the spirit and sense of the Founding. In looking back, we may find the light to lead us forward. <br />""In his American Gospel, Jon Meacham provides a refreshingly clear, balanced, and wise historical portrait of religion and American politics at exactly the moment when such fairness and understanding are much needed. Anyone who doubts the relevance of history to our own time has only to read this exceptional book.""-David McCullough, author of 1776 <br />""Jon Meacham has given us an insightful and eloquent account of the spiritual foundation of the early days of the American republic. It is especially instructive reading at a time when the nation is at once engaged in and deeply divided on the question of religion and its place in public life.""-Tom Brokaw, author of The Greatest Generation <br />""An absorbing narrative full of vivid characters and fresh thinking, American Gospel tells how the Founding Fathers-and their successors-struggled with their own religious and political convictions to work out the basic structure for freedom of religion. For me this book was nonstop reading.""-Elaine Pagels, professor of religion, Princeton University, author of Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas <br />""Jon Meacham is one of our country's most brilliant thinkers about religion's impact on American society. In this scintillating and provocative book, Meacham reveals the often-hidden influence of religious belief on the Founding Fathers and on later generations of American citizens and leaders up to our own. Today, as we argue more strenuously than ever about the proper place of religion in our politics and the rest of American life, Meacham's important book should serve as the touchstone of the debate."" <br />-Michael Beschloss, author of The Conquerors <br />""At a time when faith and freedom seem increasingly polarized, American Gospel recovers our vital center-the middle ground where, historically, religion and public life strike a delicate balance. Well researched, well written, inspiring, and persuasive, this is a welcome addition to the literature.""-Jonathan D. Sarna, Joseph H. &amp; Belle R.

But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.<br /><br />First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.

He shows that despite reactionary fire-breathers and fanatics, religion has often been a progressive force in American politics and explains why the policy of a separate church and state has, ironically, made the position of the church stronger.<br /><br /><br /><br />Marked by the extraordinary quality of observation that has defined the work of Garry Wills, <i>Under God</i> is a rich, original look at why religion and politics will never be separate in the United States."

A Confederacy of Dunces,,John Kennedy Toole,eng,968084,,Louisiana State University Press,338,,,,"""A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.""<br /><br /> Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. (""Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss."") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. <br /><br />Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. --Alix Wilber--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.<br /><br /> <br /><br />From Library Journal<br /><br /> The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel with the sad history turns 20 (LJ 4/15/80).

He is so widely loved that it seems no detective stories existed before his character was created. One reason people like to read detective stories is because in real life crimes can go unsolved and unpunished. A crime causes disorder. A detective's job is to solve the crime so our social relationships can be put back in order. The heroes of detective stories show how even very puzzling crimes can be explained. This helps us believe that justice is still possible.<br /><br />Sometimes Holmes solves mysteries that do not involve a crime. But in any case, his techniques are the same. First, he makes keen observations. He looks very closely at what the details of a person's appearance reveal. Second he is strictly logical. He always finds as many facts about a case as he can before he starts thinking about a theory that would fit them together. Third, he is ready to use disguises and a little trickery to find clues.<br /><br />(back cover)<br /><br />The speckled band --	<br />The red-headed league --	<br />The adventure of the engineer's thumb --	<br />The adventure of the blue carbuncle --	<br />The adventure of the copper beeches."

The Grand Complication,,Allen Kurzweil,,748168,,Hyperion,,,,,"Narrated by Alexander Short, a stylish young reference librarian of arcane interests, <i>The Grand Complication</i> propels the reader through a card catalog of desperation and delight, of intrigue and theft. It’s a novel of suspense that comes full circle, with a clock-maker’s precision and a storyteller’s surprise, on page 360.<br /><br />The account begins with Alexander’s job in jeopardy and his marriage destined for the Discard shelf. Enter the improbably named Henry James Jesson III, a bibliophile who hires the librarian for some after-hours research. The task: to render whole an incomplete cabinet of wonders chronicling the life of a mysterious eighteenth-century inventor. As the investigation heats up, Alexander realizes there are many more secrets lurking in Jesson’s cloistered world than those found inside his elegant Manhattan town house. With a notebook tethered to his jacket, Alexander plunges headlong into the search, only to discover that the void in the cabinet is rivaled by an emptiness in his heart.<br /><br />A delicious compendium of quirky colleagues, erotic pop-ups, deviant passions, and miraculous examples of theft, the book is a grand and complicated “timepiece,” told with a devilish sense of fun.<br /><br />(From the colophon: <i>The tiny gear used as a space break is a freehand rendering of an escapement wheel contained inside the Marie Antoinette, Abraham-Louis Breguet’s pocket watch masterpiece. The whereabouts of of the watch, stolen from a Jerusalem museum in 1983, is unknown.</i>)"

"Am Rande des Wahnsinns (Bridget Jones, #2)",,Helen Fielding,ger,8140,,,,49352,Bridget Jones,2,"Die Fans von Helen Fieldings <i>Schokolade zum Frühstück</i> werden sich erinnern, dass die eigenwillige Heldin Bridget am Ende dieser schlauen und komischen Version von Jane Austens <i>Stolz und Vorurteil</i> endlich ihren Mr. Darcy -- Mark Darcy, um genau zu sein -- an Land zieht.<p> <i>Am Rande des Wahnsinns</i> setzt vier Wochen danach ein, und die Flitterwochen sind bereits vorbei. Nicht nur, dass sie entdeckt, dass der Mann ihrer Träume die Konservativen wählt, die eher linksorientierte Bridget fühlt sich zudem ein wenig unbehaglich mit den Alltäglichkeiten, die das Teilen von Bett und Tisch mit einer anderen Person mit sich bringt: ""Sehr kompliziert, einen Mann tatsächlich im Haus zu haben; kann nicht die erforderliche Zeit im Bad verbringen oder selbiges in eine Gaskammer verwandeln; muss berücksichtigen, dass er nicht zu spät zur Arbeit kommt oder vielleicht dringend pinkeln muss etc.; es ist mir auch unangenehm, dass Mark seine Unterhose nachts zusammenlegt; ist mir plötzlich seltsam peinlich, meine eigenen Klamotten einfach als Haufen auf dem Boden liegen zu lassen.""</p><p> Aber all diese Probleme verblassen zur Bedeutungslosigkeit, als Rebecca die Szene betritt, eine schöne, Männer verschlingende Nemesis in Persona mit ""Oberschenkeln wie eine junge Giraffe"" und absolut keinem Freundinnen-Moralkodex, wenn es darum geht, dem Mann einer anderen nachzustellen. Es dauert nicht lange, bis Rebeccas Manipulationen, Bridgets eigene Unsicherheiten und eine Reihe von Missverständnissen (angefangen bei einem nackten philippinischen Jungen in Mark Darcys Bett bis hin zu einem anzüglichen Valentinsgruß vom Besitzer von Bridgets chemischer Reinigung) zu folgendem Ergebnis führen: ""57 kg (gut), Alkoholeinheiten 0 (ausgezeichnet), Zigaretten 5 (eine angenehme, gesunde Menge), an Mark Darcys Haus vorbeigefahren 2 mal (s.g.), Mark Darcys Name im Telefonbuch nachgeschlagen, zur Bestätigung, dass er noch lebt 18 mal (s.g.), 1471-Anrufe 12 (noch besser), Anrufe von Mark 0 (tragisch)."" Zum Glück hat Bridget genügend andere Probleme am Hals, um sich abzulenken. Ihre Mutter ist von einer Reise nach Kenia zurückgekehrt mit einem jungen Massai im Schlepptau -- zur Bestürzung ihres Vaters; ihre besten Freunde Jude, Shazzer und Tom sind alle selbst in der Rendezvous-Hölle gefangen; ihre Wohnung ist in einem heillosen Durcheinander, dank eines kauzigen Schreiners; ein unzuverlässiger Ex-Freund ist gerade wieder in ihr Leben zurückgekehrt; und nun schickt ihr auch noch jemand Todesdrohungen -- könnte es Mark Darcy sein? Wenn <i>Schokolade zum Frühstück</i> eine moderne Version von <i>Stolz und Vorurteil</i> war, dann bedient sich sein Nachfolger einiger Themen und Kunstgriffe (und sogar beim Titel eines Abschnitts) eines anderen Austen-Romans, <i>Verführung -- Überredung</i>. Und wie in Austens Geschichten, ist auch hier die Reise das eigentliche Ziel. Ein Happy-End für Bridget und ihre Freunde steht von vornherein fest; wie sie dort hinkommen, wird Sie allerdings voller Spannung auf der Stuhlkante hin- und herrutschen lassen -- wenn Sie nicht schon vor lauter Lachen heruntergefallen sind. <i>--Alix Wilbur</i></p>"

Munchausen by proxy (MBP) is the world’s most hidden and dangerous form of child abuse, in which the caretaker—almost always the mother—invents or induces symptoms in her child because she craves the attention of medical professionals. Many MBP children die, but Julie Gregory not only survived, she escaped the powerful orbit of her mother's madness and rebuilt her identity as a vibrant, healthy young woman.<br /><br />Punctuated with Julie's actual medical records, Sickened re-creates the bizarre cocoon of her family's isolated double-wide trailer, their wild shopping sprees and gun-waving confrontations, the astonishing naïveté of medical professionals and social workers. It also exposes the twisted bonds of terror and love that roped Julie's family together—including the love that made a child willing to sacrifice herself to win her mother's happiness.<br /><br />The realization that the sickness lay in her mother, not in herself, would not come to Julie until adulthood. But when it did, it would strike like lightning. Through her painful metamorphosis, she discovered the courage to save her own life—and, ultimately, the life of the girl her mother had found to replace her.

During his journeys, he encounters the woman he loved as a youth; and the renewed promise of her love, as well as the mysterious presence of an itinerant dancing girl, sends him on a spiritual odyssey that forces him to question the nature of his ambition and the folly of uncritical reverence for authority. <br />With the exquisite prose and masterful narrative drive that have earned him widespread acclaim, Barry Unsworth transports the reader to a distant past filled with deception and mystery, and whose racial, tribal, and religious tensions are still with us today."

  <i>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</i>
</a> to the top of bestseller lists and forever altered the vocabulary of dating, Fielding executes a remarkable spoof on the altruistic endeavors of commoners and celebrities alike as they unite to combat the horror of famine and neglect in Africa. Populated by larger-than-life characters from London's West End and the unsung heroes toiling anonymously on the Continent, <i>Cause Celeb</i> is a cunning and poignant tale that discloses the romantic underpinnings of life and love in the 21st century.<br /><p><br />Rosie Richardson, a frothy young woman trapped in the cauldron of the publishing world, finds herself involved in a dysfunctional relationship with TV personality Oliver Marchant, a Teflon-coated Romeo who slips in and out of her life with greater frequency than she'd like. Disenchanted with their glamorous lifestyle, Rosie packs her bags and (quite literally) heads for the hills, embarking on a personal odyssey through the majestic deserts of Africa to the fictional state of Nambula, where each day's sunrise brings a daunting challenge. <br /></p><p><br />Upon arrival in the sparse refugee camp, Rosie immediately gets a sense of just how eccentric some of her new neighbors are. Muhammed, a local go-between with a flair for melodrama, the burly Irish doctor O'Rourke, and two seasoned nurses are all catalysts for the story who keep spirits alive and send emotions on a roller-coaster ride. When a carpet of locusts wreaks havoc among vestiges of the season's last crops, disease and starvation become a palpable threat that plagues the proud refugees of Nambula with fear. <br /></p><p><br />But stubborn government regimes turn a blind eye to the dangers facing the village, the relief workers' pleas for food and assistance are ignored, and fever and calamity run rampant, forcing Rosie to return to London and enlist the help of her former lover and the motley crew of friends they once shared. In a final, inspired act of desperation, the former publicity flak miraculously pulls off an international appeal with results that far surpass anything she had imagined. <br /></p><p><br />With a winning combination of pathos and humor, Fielding suggests that the real voyage of discovery is not simply in the quest for new landscapes, but in having new eyes to view them with. Ultimately, Rosie does find the peace of mind and passion she so desperately sought, and the success of her cause adds substance to her life and a depth to her character she had never suspected. Like the Bridget Jones novels, <i>Cause Celeb</i> is an easy, enjoyable read. But despite its seeming frivolity, the book paints an insightful and sanguine portrait of modern-day philanthropy. It's just that in the world according to Helen Fielding, even saving lives can be cause for merriment.<br /></p><p>

Ricos Y Famosos En Nambula / Cause Celeb (Best Seller),,Helen Fielding,,8162,,,,,,,"Helen Fielding's novel Bridget Jones's Diary had a meandering, rather shapeless shape (as diaries will). Both fans and critics of that 1998 smash hit will be surprised to find that the author's first novel, previously unpublished in the United States, is a lot more sophisticated in structure. And Cause Celeb is nearly as fun as Bridget Jones's Diary, which is saying a lot, especially since Fielding's debut is about African famine. The narrator, Rosie Richardson, runs a relief camp in the invented country of Nambula. Henry, the most flippant member of her staff, wears a T-shirt that tersely lists the various motivations for relief workers to come to Africa: ""(a) Missionary? (b) Mercenary? (c) Misfit? (d) Broken heart?"" As Rosie herself admits, she is ""a c/d hybrid and soft in the head to boot.""<br /><br />Flashbacks reveal that in London, Rosie had fallen in love with an erratic, emotionally abusive (but adorable!) newscaster. As she trailed about town in Oliver's wake, she came to know his in-crowd of movie stars, directors, and musicians. Her split with this media magnet is what initially sent her to Africa. Four years into Rosie's exile, however, a plague of locusts descends on the crops of a neighboring country, and refugees begin to flood her camp. She decides there's only one thing to do: go back home and round up her old celeb pals for a benefit TV special.<br /><br />It should come as no shock that the London sequences are great fun, as is the climactic collision between movie stars and refugees. But the real treat is Fielding's handling of the camp sequences. Rosie and her staff struggle with their petty emotions as they confront the incredible suffering in front of them. Henry watches in disbelief as some starving refugees move their tent to a better location: ""Never mind the old malnutrition--you go for the view."" A newswoman visits the camp, and, fraught with emotion after first seeing the starving children, she caresses Rosie, whose response is this: ""I hope the famine hadn't turned her into a lesbian."" Fielding has found a voice that is both compassionate and irreverent, a rare and wonderful combination. --Claire Dederer"

The Forgotten Commissioner: Sir William Mildmay and the Anglo-French Commission of 1750-1755,,Enid Robbie,,8191,,Michigan State University Press,307,,,,"As a middle-aged London lawyer, Sir William Mildmay had a reputation for prudence and frugality that landed him a position on the Anglo-French Commission in Paris. The Commission's ongoing negotiations and failure to ratify the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle and resolve long-standing differences were to have far-reaching consequences for the futures of Britain, France, Canada, the American colonies, and India. The contents of William Mildmay's letters, his private commission journal, and his official commission reports provide remarkable first-hand insight into the tortuous process of eighteenth-century diplomacy. Mildmay's notes also raise the fascinating possibility that in the early summer of 1752 a successful end of the treaty negotiations might have been possible, thus preventing or delaying the Seven Years' War. Given the importance of the resulting conflagration for Britain and its Empire, Mildmay's detailed descriptions of the commission's work is a remarkable and unique chronicle of a crucial episode in British and French diplomacy. Enid Robbie's Forgotten Commissioner resurrects the uncertainties, personalities, infighting, and political double-dealing behind the Anglo-French Commission through an examination of one of its quietest but most dedicated participants. As Robbie weaves Mildmay's personal fortunes through the larger diplomatic negotiations, the reader understands that politics and diplomacy were life and death professions, not just for nations, but for individual careers."

Sam Houston took the problem all the way to the President of the United States Andrew Jackson. As a man of honor, Sam Houston demanded the United States honor their promises.

Since not enough is understood about the situation to justify any interference with their evolution, the Service has no power to act; its agents must go as helpless observers, posing as natives, in the hope of gaining knowledge that may help to save other worlds. This passive role proves intolerable to the young, inexperienced agent assigned to the same city as Elana, a city under totalitarian rule. After falling in love with a local girl who has become Elana's closest friend, he identifies too completely with the natives and unwittingly endangers the entire world by a well-meant but ill-advised attempt to intervene. Forced to assume responsibility for undoing the damage, Elana finds that only she--at great cost--can prevent an immediate war of annihilation.<br /><br />Although this book has the same heroine as Enchantress from the Stars, it should not be considered a sequel, as it is a completely independent story that is not appropriate for readers as young as many who enjoy the earlier book.

Venter hoped that by decoding the genome ahead of schedule, he would speed up the pace of biomedical research and save the lives of thousands of people. He also hoped to become very famous and very rich. Calling his company Celera (from the Latin for “speed”), he assembled a small group of scientists in an empty building in Rockville, Maryland, and set to work.<br />At the same time, the leaders of the government program, under the direction of Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, began to mobilize an unexpectedly unified effort to beat Venter to the prize—knowledge that had the potential to revolutionize medicine and society. <br /><br />The stage was set for one of the most thrilling—and important—dramas in the history of science. <i>The Genome War </i>is the definitive account of that drama—the race for the greatest prize biology has had to offer, told by a writer with exclusive access to Venter’s operation from start to finish. It is also the story of how one man’s ambition created a scientific Camelot where, for a moment, it seemed that the competing interests of pure science and commercial profit might be gloriously reconciled—and the national repercussions that resulted when that dream went awry.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

For Hemingway, hunting was more than just a passion; it was a means through which to explore our humanity and man’s relationship to nature. Courage, awe, respect, precision, patience—these were the virtues that Hemingway honored in the hunter, and his ability to translate these qualities into prose has produced some of the strongest accounts of sportsmanship of all time.<br /> <br /><i>Hemingway on Hunting</i> offers the full range of Hemingway’s writing about the hunting life. With selections from his best-loved novels and stories, along with journalistic pieces from such magazines as <i>Esquire</i> and <i>Vogue</i>, this spectacular collection is a must-have for anyone who has ever tasted the thrill of the hunt—in person or on the page."

He fished the lakes and creeks near the family's summer home at Walloon Lake, Michigan, and his first stories and reportages were often about his favorite sport. Here, collected for the first time in one volume, are all of his great writings about the many kinds of fishing he did—from trout in the rivers of northern Michigan to marlin in the Gulf Stream.<br /><br />In <i>A Moveable Feast,</i> Hemingway speaks of sitting in a café in Paris and writing about what he knew best—and when it came time to stop, he “did not want to leave the river.” The story was the unforgettable classic, “Big Two-Hearted River,” and from its first words we do not want to leave the river either. He also wrote articles for the <i>Toronto Star</i> on fishing in Canada and Europe and, later, articles for <i>Esquire</i> about his growing passion for big-game fishing. His last books, <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> and <i>Islands in the Stream,</i> celebrate his vast knowledge of the ocean and his affection for its great denizens.<br /> <br /><i>Hemingway on Fishing</i> is an encompassing, diverse, and fascinating collection. From the early Nick Adams stories and the memorable chapters on fishing the Irati River in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> to such late novels as <i>Islands in the Stream,</i> this collection traces the evolution of a great writer's passion; the range of his interests; the sure use he made of fishing, transforming it into the stuff of great literature.<br /> <br />Anglers and lovers of great writing alike will welcome this important collection."
Islands in the Stream,,Ernest Hemingway,eng,1153954,,Scribner,448,,,,"First published in 1970, nine years after Ernest Hemingway's death, <i>Islands in the Stream</i> is the story of an artist and adventurer — a man much like Hemingway himself. Rich with the uncanny sense of life and action characteristic of his writing — from his earliest stories <i>(In Our Time)</i> to his last novella <i>(The Old Man and the Sea)</i> — this compelling novel contains both the warmth of recollection that inspired <i>A Moveable Feast</i> and a rare glimpse of Hemingway's rich and relaxed sense of humor, which enlivens scene after scene. <br /> Beginning in the 1930s, <i>Islands in the Stream</i> follows the fortunes of Thomas Hudson from his experiences as a painter on the Gulf Stream island of Bimini, where his loneliness is broken by the vacation visit of his three young sons, to his antisubmarine activities off the coast of Cuba during World War II. The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters — including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations — engages in incomparably rich dialogue. A brilliant portrait of the inner life of a complex and endlessly intriguing man, <i>Islands in the Stream</i> is Hemingway at his mature best."

Death in the Afternoon,,Ernest Hemingway,,360058,,Vintage,496,,,,"Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and ""the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick."" Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning.<br /><br />A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature."

His works have been translated into every major language, and the Nobel Prize awarded to him in 1954 recognized his impact on contemporary writing. <p> While many people are familiar with the public image of Hemingway and the legendary accounts of his life, few knew him as an intimate. With this collection of letters, presented for the first time as a Scribner Classic, a new Hemingway emerges. Ranging from 1917 to 1961, this generous selection of nearly six hundred letters is, in effect, both a self-portrait and an autobiography. In his own words, Hemingway candidly reveals himself to a wide variety of people: family, friends, enemies, editors, translators, and almost all the prominent writers of his day. In so doing he proves to be one of the most entertaining letter writers of all time. </p><p> Carlos Baker has chosen letters that not only represent major turning points in Hemingway's career but also exhibit character, wit, and the writer's typical enthusiasm for hunting, fishing, drinking, and eating. A few are ingratiating, some downright truculent. Others present his views on writing and reading, criticize books by friend or foe, and discuss women, soldiers, politicians, and prizefighters. Perhaps more than anything, these letters show Hemingway's irrepressible humor, given far freer rein in his correspondence than in his books. An informal biography in letters, the product of forty-five years' living and writing, <i>Ernest Hemingway: Selected Letters</i> leaves an indelible impression of an extraordinary man. </p><p> Ernest Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1899. At seventeen he left home to join the Kansas City Star as a reporter, then volunteered to serve in the Red Cross during the First World War. He was severely wounded at the Italian front and was awarded the Croce di Guerra. He moved to Paris in 1921, where he devoted himself to writing fiction, and where he fell in with the expatriate circle that included Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and Ford Madox Ford. His novels include <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> (1926), <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> (1929), <i>To Have and Have Not</i> (1937), <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> (1940), and <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> (1952).

The Imaginary Girlfriend,,John Irving,eng,3034226,,Ballantine Books,208,,,,"Dedicated to the memory of two wrestling coaches and two writer friends, <i>The Imaginary Girlfriend</i> is John Irving's candid memoir of his twin careers in writing and wrestling. The award-winning author of best-selling novels from <i>The World According to Garp</i> to <i>In One Person</i>, Irving began writing when he was fourteen, the same age at which he began to wrestle at Exeter. He competed as a wrestler for twenty years, was certified as a referee at twenty-four, and coached the sport until he was forty-seven. Irving coached his sons Colin and Brendan to New England championship titles, a championship that he himself was denied.<br /><br />In an autobiography filled with the humor and compassion one finds in his fiction, Irving explores the interrelationship between the two disciplines of writing and wrestling, from the days when he was a beginner at both until his fourth wresting related surgery at the age of fifty-three. Writing as a father and mentor, he offers a lucid portrait of those—writers and wrestlers from Kurt Vonnegut to Ted Seabrooke—who played a mentor role in his development as a novelist, wrestler, and wrestling coach. He reveals lessons he learned about the pursuit for which he is best known, writing. “And,” as the Denver Post observed, in filling “his narrative with anecdotes that are every bit as hilarious as the antics in his novels, Irving combines the lessons of both obsessions (wrestling and writing) . . . into a somber reflection on the importance of living well.”"
A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound,"[{'id': '3075', 'name': 'John Irving', 'role': ''}, {'id': '163608', 'name': 'Tatjana Hauptmann', 'role': 'Illustrator'}]",John Irving,eng,274940,,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,32,,,,"In John Irving's ninth novel <i>A Widow for One Year</i>, a creepy children's book author named Ted Cole writes a bedtime story about things that go bump in the night. That odd, gently comical tale is brought to life here with Tatjana Hauptmann's shadowy, moonlit pencil illustrations. Young Tom wakes up in the middle of the night to an unusual sound, but his two-year-old brother Tim does not. When his fathers asks what it sounded like, Tom reveals a number of silly and scary options: ""like a monster with no arms and no legs,"" or ""a dog trying to open a door,"" or ""a ghost dropping stolen peanuts""--""a sound like someone trying not to make a sound,"" in fact. The illustrations--with a smattering of wordless spreads--show the pajama-clad Tom wandering alone through a big empty house as bulges in the wall and long shadows hint at unseen horrors. In the end, the father tells his boys that the sound is just a mouse in the wall. Tom is immensely relieved, but baby Tim screams because he doesn't know what a mouse is, and stays up all night to ward off the furry, mysterious thing. Not too scary, nor too comforting, Irving's picture-book debut imaginatively captures that late-night world where everything looks and sounds a little like a monster.

A Widow for One Year,,John Irving,,3359767,,Ballantine Books,576,,,,"“One night when she was four and sleeping in the bottom bunk of her bunk bed, Ruth Cole woke to the sound of lovemaking—it was coming from her parents’ bedroom.”<br /><br />This sentence opens John Irving’s ninth novel, A Widow for One Year, a story of a family marked by tragedy. Ruth Cole is a complex, often self-contradictory character—a “difficult” woman. By no means is she conventionally “nice,” but she will never be forgotten.<br /><br />Ruth’s story is told in three parts, each focusing on a critical time in her life. When we first meet her—on Long Island, in the summer of 1958—Ruth is only four.<br /><br />The second window into Ruth’s life opens on the fall of 1990, when she is an unmarried woman whose personal life is not nearly as successful as her literary career. She distrusts her judgment in men, for good reason.<br /><br />A Widow for One Year closes in the autumn of 1995, when Ruth Cole is a forty-one-year-old widow and mother. She’s about to fall in love for the first time.<br /><br />Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing, A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force. Both ribald and erotic, it is also a brilliant novel about the passage of time and the relentlessness of grief.<br />Source: john-irving.com"

He does not understand the modern obsession with talking about everything. “The secret of contentment, George felt, lay in ignoring many things completely.” Some things in life, however, cannot be ignored.<br /><br />At 61, George is settling down to a comfortable retirement, building a shed in his garden, reading historical novels and listening to a bit of light jazz. Then his tempestuous daughter, Katie, announces that she is getting re-married, to the deeply inappropriate Ray. Her family is not pleased – as her brother Jamie observes, Ray has “strangler’s hands.” Katie can’t decide if she loves Ray, or loves the wonderful way he has with her son Jacob, and her mother Jean is a bit put out by all the planning and arguing the wedding has occasioned, which get in the way of her quite fulfilling late-life affair with one of her husband’s ex-colleagues. And the tidy and pleasant life Jamie has created crumbles when he fails to invite his lover, Tony, to the dreaded nuptials. <br /><br />Unnoticed in the uproar, George discovers a sinister lesion on his hip, and quietly begins to lose his mind. <br /><br />The way these damaged people fall apart – and come together – as a family is the true subject of Haddon’s disturbing yet amusing portrait of a dignified man trying to go insane politely.<br /><br />A SPOT OF BOTHER is Mark Haddon’s unforgettable follow-up to the internationally beloved bestseller THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.

His mother, Iris Tree, was a well-known poet-actress-adventuress whose circle included British bluebloods Nancy Cunard and Diana Cooper, and Bloomsburyites Carrington, Lytton Strachey, and Augustus John. Ivan’s photographer father, Curtis Moffat, came from a well-connected New York family, studied with Man Ray, and had an audacious showroom that focused on Moderne furniture and lighting, some of which he designed himself. But Ivan Moffat’s extraordinary pedigree was only the foundation upon which he built his own equally extraordinary and surprisingly active personal life, populated by the leading artists and personalities of his day—from Aldous Huxley and Dylan Thomas to Preston Sturges, Charlie Chaplin, Billy Wilder, and David Selznick.<br /><br />In 1943 Moffat enlisted in the army and was assigned to Stevens’s unit, started by Eisenhower, which covered the last stage of World War II, from D-day to the fall of Berlin and the liberation of the concentration camps. After the war, Stevens invited Moffat to become an associate producer for his new Hollywood company. Moffat’s unofficial credits on the screenplays for A Place in the Sun and Shane and his co-writing credit on Giant led to a successful screenwriting career, and at the same time he became a leading social figure in Hollywood. Moffat had affairs with many women—from a waitress to a duchess, from a stripper to a movie star. The most serious affair of his life was probably with the <br />novelist Caroline Blackwood.<br /><br />At the center of The Ivan Moffat File is the elegantly written autobiography that Moffat was working on at the time of his death in 2002, to which Gavin Lambert adds never-before-seen letters, interviews, and screenplays, as well as many anecdotes and his own memories of Moffat. The result is a re-creation of the life of this unique figure, flamboyant and mysterious."

Sun Tzu's writings are unsurpassed in depth of understanding, shedding light not only on battlefield maneuvers, but also on the relevant economic, political, and psychological factors that can shape the outcome of warfare. Equally important, the precepts outlined by Sun Tzu over two thousand years ago can be applied with great success outside the theater of war. Indeed, it is read avidly by corporate executives worldwide and has been touted in the movie Wall Street and the television series The Sopranos as the ultimate guide to strategy. Finally, this edition offers the definitive translation of Sun Tzu's text, by former U.S. Marine Brigadier General Samuel Griffith, who was also an authority on Mao Tse-Tung.<br /><br />Remarkable for its clear organization, lucid prose, and the acuity of its intellectual and moral insights, <i>The Art of War</i> is the definitive study of combat.

Agincourt 1415: Triumph Against the Odds,,Matthew Bennett,,1682346,,Praeger Publishers,96,286956,Osprey Campaign,9,"Agincourt is one of the most evocative names in English military history. Remembered as a fifteenth-century Dunkirk, the battle is part of the great English tradition of victory in the face of vastly superior forces. The French army, according to chroniclers, was between three to six times as large as that of the English and composed the flower of France's chivalry. Henry V's forces were numerically weakened by their earlier siege-action at Harfleur, and had become increasingly tired, hungry, and ill as they journeyed through enemy territory on their way to the safe port of Calais. The appearance of large French forces blocking their way seemed to signal the end of Henry V's brief attempt at the crown of France. However, the English had several advantages over their enemies. Not only was their command structure far more coherent than that of the French, but also their forces had far greater tactical flexibility. English success in arms was based on the extremely effective combination of heavily armoured men-at-arms with troops armed with the long-range, quick-firing longbow. The havoc that this weapon wreaked on the French forces before they were close enough to engage with the English knights was crucial for the English victory, as was the disorganisation of the French forces and the unforeseen problems in their pre-prepared battle plan. Matthew Bennett examines the Agincourt campaign from the siege of Harfleur to the aftermath of the battle at Agincourt itself. Ably using original fifteenth century evidence, including the surviving French battle plan and the accounts of men present in both armies, Bennett discusses the lead-up to the battle, the tactical dispositions of the two forcesand the reasons for the ultimate English success. What results is a full and extremely interesting account of one of the most important campaigns of the Hundred Years' War."

Crecy 1346: Triumph of the Longbow,,David Nicolle,,1223194,,Praeger Publishers,96,286956,Osprey Campaign,71,"The Battle of Crecy was the first major land battle of the Hundred Years War. It pitted the French army, then considered the best in Europe, and their miscellaneous allies against the English under King Edward III and the 'Black Prince', who as yet had no great military reputation; this was the battle where he 'won his spurs'. The Genoese crossbowmen were outshot by the English longbows and the pattern was set for the rest of the day: the French cavalry were committed piecemeal in fruitless charges against strong English positions, losing perhaps 10,000 men in the course of the fighting. After almost a millennium in which cavalry had dominated the field of battle, the infantryman, and particularly the longbowman, now ruled supreme. David Nicolle explores this first of the great 'Longbow' victories which established the reputation of this fearsome weapon."
Granada 1492: The Twilight of Moorish Spain,,David Nicolle,,2122613,,Praeger Publishers,,286956,Osprey Campaign,53,"By 1481 Granada was the last Islamic enclave in Catholic Spain. Granada's last ruler, Muhammad XII 'Boadbil', faced the might of a Spanish royal army revitalised and lavishly equipped with modern artillery. Despite this mismatch of strength it took 11 years of hard campaigning before the Spanish troops could bring their guns to bear on the walls of Granada. After this, the outcome could not be long delayed. Andalusia, the physical embodiment of the flowering Islamic culture in Spain, was snuffed out. Nevertheless, although the fall of Granada meant the end of Muslim Spain, completing the long wished for 'Reconquista', it also signalled the beginning of a united Spain. Fernando and Isabel, already jointly holding the crowns of Castile and Aragon, used the victory to promote feelings of unity amongst their subjects: in spite of most of the rewards of the campaign going to Castilian nobles, the fall of Granada was nevertheless the achievement of the whole of Spain, using resources from both Castile and Aragon. David Nicolle investigates the 11-year campaign that culminated in the 'Reconquista' phase of the Iberian Peninsula's history. The commanders, forces, plans and campaign itself are all examined closely in this superbly illustrated account of 'Los Reyes Catolicos' greatest victory."

Their findings lay bare a disturbing and incontrovertible truth: that the American dream of racial integration, forty-two years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, still eludes us - and, in fact, may not happen in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The authors examine the ways in which forces that contribute to strong neighborhoods work against the idea of integration. They explain why residents of neighborhoods with weak social organizations often choose to move rather than confront unwanted ethnic or racial change. Finally, the authors make clear that the racial and ethnic tensions that have become all but inherent to urban neighborhoods have urgent implications for Americans at every level of society.<br /><br />Groundbreaking, authoritative, eye-opening, and certain to rekindle, and permanently alter, the discussion of race relations in our time."

These four novels display the versatility and emotional directness that have made Steinbeck one of America’s most enduringly popular writers.<br /><br /><em>The Moon Is Down</em> (1942), set in an unnamed Scandinavian country under German occupation, dramatizes the transformation of ordinary life under totalitarian rule and the underground struggle against the Nazi invaders. Told largely in dialogue, the book was conceived simultaneously as a novel and a play, and was successfully produced on Broadway. Although some American critics found its treatment of the German characters too sympathetic, <em>The Moon Is Down</em> was widely read in occupied areas of Europe, where it was regarded as an inspiring contribution to the resistance.<br /><br />In <em>Cannery Row</em> (1945) Steinbeck paid tribute to his closest friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, in the central character of Doc, proprietor of the Western Biological Laboratory and spiritual and financial mainstay of a cast of philosophical drifters and hangers-on. The comic and bawdy evocation of Monterey’s sardine-canning district—""a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream""—has made this one of the most popular of all of Steinbeck’s novels.<br /><br />Steinbeck’s long involvement with Mexican culture is distilled in <em>The Pearl</em> (1947). Expanding on an anecdote he heard in Baja California about a local boy who had found a pearl of unusual size, Steinbeck turned it into a parable of the corrupting influence of sudden wealth. The Pearl appears here with the original illustrations by José Clemente Orozco.<br /><br />Ambitious in scale and original in structure, <em>East of Eden</em> (1952) recounts the violent and emotionally turbulent history of a Salinas Valley family through several generations. Drawing on Biblical parallels, encompassing a period stretching from the Civil War to World War I, and incorporating, as counterpoint to the central story, some of the actual history of Steinbeck’s mother’s family, <em>East of Eden</em> is an epic that explores the writer’s deepest and most anguished concerns within a landscape that for him had mythic resonance.

The flow of the main plot is frequently interrupted by short vignettes that introduce us to various denizens of the Row, most of whom are not directly connected with the central story. These vignettes are often characterized by direct or indirect reference to extreme violence: suicides, corpses, and the cruelty of the natural world.<br /><br />The ""story"" of <i>Cannery Row</i> follows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row.<br /><br />Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row."

Written in an incredibly compressed five-month period, the novel had an electrifying impact upon publication in 1939, unleashing a political storm with its vision of America’s dispossessed struggling for survival. It continues to exert a powerful influence on American culture, and has inspired artists as diverse as John Ford, Woody Guthrie, and Bruce Springsteen. Tracing the journey of the Joad family from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the migrant camps of California, Steinbeck creates an American epic, spacious, impassioned, and pulsating with the rhythms of living speech. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and has since sold millions of copies worldwide.<br /><br />This text of <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> has been newly edited based on Steinbeck’s manuscript, typescript, and proofs. Many errors have been corrected, and words omitted or misconstrued by his typist have been restored. In addition, <em>The Harvest Gypsies</em>, his 1936 investigative report on migrant workers, which laid the groundwork for the novel, is included as an appendix.<br /><br /><em>The Long Valley</em> (1938) displays Steinbeck’s brilliance as a writer of short stories, including such classics as “The Chrysanthemums,” “The White Quail,” “Flight,” and “The Red Pony.” Set in the Salinas Valley landscape that was Steinbeck’s enduring inspiration, the stories explore moments of fear, tenderness, isolation, and violence with poetic intensity.<br /><br /><em>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</em>, an account of the 1940 marine biological expedition in which Steinbeck participated with his close friend Ed Ricketts, is a unique blend of science, philosophy, and adventure, as well as one of Steinbeck’s most revealing expositions of his core beliefs. First published in 1941 as part of the collaborative volume <em>Sea of Cortez</em>, Steinbeck’s narrative was reissued separately a decade later, augmented by the moving tribute “About Ed Ricketts.”<br /><br />This volume contains a newly researched chronology, notes, and an essay on textual selection.

All too often throughout the ages of exploration, voyages ended in disaster when crew and cargo were either lost at sea or destroyed upon the rocks of an unexpected landfall. Thousands of lives and the fortunes of nations hung on a resolution to the longitude problem.<br /><br />To encourage a solution, governments established prizes for anyone whose method or device proved successful. The largest reward of £20,000 - truly a king's ransom - was offered by Britain's Parliament in 1714. The scientific establishment - from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton - had been certain that a celestial answer would be found and invested untold effort in this pursuit. By contrast, John Harrison imagined and built the unimaginable: a clock that told perfect time at sea, known today as the chronometer. Harrison's trials and tribulations during his forty-year quest to win the prize are the culmination of this remarkable story.<br /><br /><i>The Illustrated Longitude</i> brings a new and important dimension to Dava Sobel's celebrated story.

Sibert Honor Book<br /><br />By the start of the eighteenth century, many thousands of sailors had perished at sea because their captains had no way of knowing longitude, their east-west location. Latitude, the north-south position, was easy enough, but once out of sight of land not even the most experienced navigator had a sure method of fixing longitude. So the British Parliament offered a substantial monetary prize to whoever could invent a device to determine exact longitude at sea. Many of the world's greatest minds tried -- and failed -- to come up with a solution. Instead, it was a country clockmaker named John Harrison who would invent a clock that could survive wild seas and be used to calculate longitude accurately. But in an aristocratic society, the road to acceptance was not a smooth one, and even when Harrison produced not one but five elegant, seaworthy timekeepers, each an improvement on the one that preceded it, claiming the prize was another battle. Set in an exciting historical framework -- telling of shipwrecks and politics -- this is the story of one man's creative vision, his persistence against great odds, and his lifelong fight for recognition of a brilliant invention. <br />"

The 1421 Heresy: An Investigation Into the Ming Chinese Maritime Survey of the World,,Anatole Andro,,8396,,Authorhouse,412,,,,"During the formative years of the Ming Dynasty the Chinese government dispatched hundreds of gigantic ships, some over 400 feet long, into the Indian Ocean. The enterprise was dubbed Zheng He's Seven Voyages to the Western Ocean because the Ming fleets, led by the legendary Admiral Zheng He, went to sea altogether seven times. After twenty-seven years these maritime expeditions mysteriously stopped. To date no scholar is entirely certain of the reason behind the undertaking. Although practically unknown in the West, these events made indelible impressions on the Southeast Asians. Today Admiral Zheng He is regarded as a god and is worshipped in temples not just in China, but throughout Southeast Asia. This year we see the 600th anniversary of the Ming Chinese launching of their monumental excursions, and scholars have renewed their interest in the historical events. There are speculations and assertions that the Ming fleets actually went beyond the Indian Ocean and even sailed to America-all before Christopher Columbus had made his momentous trips. However, researchers seem to be able to neither prove their hypotheses nor disprove them. In any case, it does seem odd that the Chinese, with their superior naval technology would choose to confine their activities to local waters only. Nevertheless, to prove that they did, one needs irrefutable evidence because the suggestion challenges centuries of established history. Historian/researcher Anatole Andro believes that if such evidence exists, it will need to be European evidence to prove the case. By leaving the Indian Ocean the Chinese would be entering European territory, so to speak. If confirmation to this effect is lacking it will not only fail to prove that the Chinese had sailed outside their local waters, but on the contrary, it would be as good as proof that the Ming Chinese never went beyond their traditional sphere of interest. For two and a half years the author searched for such evidence, examining each piece of suspected artifact and following up on every lead. Not only was he able to uncover such evidence he found the evidence to be widespread. Further, scholars had examined such evidence and either discarded, ignored, or obscured it. This book is the presentation of Mr. Andro's research data, his analyses of the data thereof, and the startling but inevitable conclusions that he arrived at. Written in easy to understand language, this book challenges you to accept his findings or dispute it. In either case it is a thrill ride."

In the three case studies, two nominal and one verbal variable are described and discussed in detail: the replacement of Old English h-&gt; pronouns by borrowed th-&gt; pronouns, the introduction and spread of the wh-&gt; relativizers, and the spread and routinization of light verb constructions (<em>take</em>, <em>make</em>, <em>give</em>, <em>have</em>, <em>do</em> plus deverbal noun).<br /><br />While the study aims at a balanced integration of theories and methods from a number of different approaches in sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, typology, and language change, its main focus is social network theory and the role of the linguistic individual in the formation and change of language structures. Questions of individual language use and of deliberate versus unmonitored changes in the (individual) system take center stage and are discussed in the light of social network analysis. Traditional empirical social network analysis is carefully revised. Despite its many merits in present-day sociolinguistics, it often needs to be supplemented by hermeneutic-biographical analyses of the individual speakers' lives when applied to historical data. With this background, common theories and models of language change, such as grammaticalization, paradigmatic pressure, typological alignment, and generational shifts, are illustrated and evaluated from the point of view of single speakers and social groups, and their particular embedding in the speech community through various network structures.<br /><br />The book is of interest to advanced students and researchers in English and general linguistics, Middle English, historical linguistics and language change, corpus linguistics, as well as sociolinguistics."

If somebody is trying to stifle your voice, you should try and make sure it speaks louder than before.- Acclaim, success, and controversy follow every one of Salman Rushdie's writings. His novels and stories have won him awards and made him both famous in the literary world and a catalyst for protests worldwide. For nearly a decade after publication of <i>The Satanic Verses</i>, he faced a bounty on his life.<br /><br />Although Rushdie has participated in a great number of interviews, many of his most revealing conversations were published in journals and newspapers throughout the globe -- not only in England and the United States, but also in India, Canada, and across Europe. Conversations with Salman Rushdie, the first collection of interviews with Rushdie, brings together the best and some of the rarest of the interviews the author has granted.<br /><br />Though many know Rushdie for his novels, what most do not realize is the breadth of Rushdie's writing and thinking. There are many other Salman Rushdies -- the travel writer, the crafter of short stories, the filmmaker, the -children's- story writer, the essayist and critic, and the unflinching commentator on contemporary culture, particularly on race and inequality.<br /><br />-The speaking of suppressed truths is one of the great possibilities of the novel, - he tells the <i>Third World Book Review</i>, -and it is perhaps the main reason why the novel becomes the most dangerous of art forms in all countries where people, governments, are trying to distort the truth.-<br /><br />Rushdie talks extensively about the creative process, about his views on art and politics, and about his life before and after the fatwa. Articulate, witty, and learned, he shows the side of himself that sparks such controversy. While not necessarily seeking to provoke, Rushdie shows how controversy is often inseparable from the politically charged situations and issues that compel him to write.<br /><br />Rushdie takes risks in his writing, pushing both the novelistic form and language to its limits. -Dispense with safety nets, - he says in <i>Imaginary Homelands</i>. These interviews reveal a man with a powerful mind, a wry sense of humor, and an unshakable commitment to justice.<br /><br />Michael R.

Through the debris of limbs, drinks trolleys, memories, blankets and oxygen masks, two figures fall towards the sea without benefit of parachutes: Gibreel Farishta, India's legendary movie star, and Saladin Chamcha, the man of a thousand voices, self-made self and Anglophile supreme. Clinging to each other, singing rival songs, they plunge downward, and are finally washed up, alive, on the snow-covered sands of an English beach. A miracle; but an ambiguous one, because it soon becomes apparent that curious changes are coming over them. Gibreel seems to have acquired a halo, while, to Saladin's dismay, his legs grow hairier, his feet turn into hoofs, and there are bumps burgeoning at his temples.<br /><br />So begins <i>The Satanic Verses</i>, Salman Rushdie's first novel for five years.<br /><br />Gibreel and Saladin have been chosen (by whom?) as protagonists in the eternal wrestling match between Good and Evil. But which is which? Can demons be angelic? Can angels be devils in disguise? As the two men tumble through their tale, through time as well as space, towards their final confrontation, we are witnesses to a cycle of extraordinary stories, tales of love and passion, of betrayal and faith: the story of Ayesha, the butterfly-shrouded visionary who leads an Indian village on an impossible pilgrimage; of Allie, the mountain-climber haunted by a ghost who urges her to attempt the ultimate feat — a solo ascent of Everest; of murders, metamorphoses and riots in a London ""visible but unseen""; and, centrally, the story of Mahound, the Prophet of Jahilia, the city of sand — Mahound, the recipient of a revelation in which satanic verses mingle with divine.<br /><br />In this great wheel of a book, where the past and the future chase each other furiously, Salman Rushdie takes us on an epic journey, a journey of tears and laughter, of wonderful stories and astonishing flights of the imagination, a journey towards the evil and the good that lie inseparably entwined within the hearts of women and of men.<br /><br /><br />--front flap"

Fury,,Salman Rushdie,eng,1440905,,Vintage,272,,,,"A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK<br /><br />“Salman Rushdie’s great grasp of the human tragicomedy–its dimensions, its absurdities and horrors–has made him one of the most intelligent fiction writers in the English language.”<br />–Gail Caldwell,<i> The Boston Globe</i><br /><br />“Fury is a profoundly, ecstatically affirmative work of fiction. It reaffirms Rushdie’s standing . . . at the very front rank of contemporary literary novelists.”<br />–<i>Baltimore Sun</i><br /><br />Malik Solanka, historian of ideas and world-famous dollmaker, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family in London without a word of explanation, and flees for New York. There’s a fury within him, and he fears he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America’s wealth and power, seeking to “erase” himself. But fury is all around him. An astonishing work of explosive energy, Fury is by turns a pitiless and pitch-black comedy, a love story of mesmerizing force, and a disturbing inquiry into the darkest side of human nature.<br /><br />“Rushdie’s ideas–about society, about culture, about politics–are embedded in his stories and in the interlocking momentum with which he tells them. . . . All of Rushdie’s synthesizing energy, the way he brings together ancient myth and old story, contemporary incident and archetypal emotion, transfigures reason into a waking dream.”<br />–<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br /><br />“Well, here it is, then, his first 3-D, full-volume American novel, finger-snapping, wildly stupefying, often slyly funny, red-blooded and red-toothed.

The Jaguar Smile: A Nicaraguan Journey,,Salman Rushdie,,525179,,Picador,160,,,,"Salman Rushdie went to Nicaragua in 1986, harboring no preconceptions of what he might find. What he discovered was overwhelming: a culture of heroes who had turned into inanimate objects and of politicians and warriors who were poets; a land of difficult, often beautiful contradictions. His perceptions always heightened by his special sensitivity to “the views from underneath,” Rushdie reveals a land resounding with the clashes between history and morality, government and individuals."
The Ground Beneath Her Feet,,Salman Rushdie,,3279710,,,,,,,"Salman Rushdie's most ambitious and accomplished novel, sure to be hailed as his masterpiece.<br /><br />At the beginning of this stunning novel, Vina Apsara, a famous and much-loved singer, is caught up in a devastating earthquake and never seen again by human eyes. This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks, and again finds her, over and over, throughout his own extraordinary life in music. Their epic romance is narrated by Ormus's childhood friend and Vina's sometime lover, her ""back-door man,"" the photographer Rai, whose astonishing voice, filled with stories, images, myths, anger, wisdom, humor, and love, is perhaps the book's true hero. Telling the story of Ormus and Vina, he finds that he is also revealing his own truths: his human failings, his immortal longings. He is a man caught up in the loves and quarrels of the age's goddesses and gods, but dares to have ambitions of his own. And lives to tell the tale.<br /><br />Around these three, the uncertain world itself is beginning to tremble and break. Cracks and tears have begun to appear in the fabric of the real. There are glimpses of abysses below the surfaces of things. The Ground Beneath Her Feet is Salman Rushdie's most gripping novel and his boldest imaginative act, a vision of our shaken, mutating times, an engagement with the whole of what is and what might be, an account of the intimate, flawed encounter between the East and the West, a brilliant remaking of the myth of Orpheus, a novel of high (and low) comedy, high (and low) passions, high (and low) culture. It is a tale of love, death, and rock 'n' roll."

"Old Wives' Tale, The",,Arnold Bennett,en-US,2248867,,,,207608,The Five Towns,5,"H.G. Wells described The Old Wives' Tale as ""by far the finest long novel written in English and in the English fashion"". He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that <i>The Old Wives' Tale</i> is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly, and, as they say, the rest is history. This novel was serialized on British television with great success circa 2000."

(It was in the autumn of the great gambling year, 1910). He had simply opened his lucky and wise mouth at the proper moment, and the money, like ripe golden fruit, had fallen into it, a gift from benign Heaven, surely a cause for happiness! And yet--he did not feel so jolly! He was surprised, he was even a little hurt, to discover by introspection that monetary gain was not necessarily accompanied by felicity.

"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",,Frank McCourt,eng,3060322,,Scribner,272,44664,Frank McCourt,3,"McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer.<br /><br />Nearly a decade ago Frank McCourt became an unlikely star when, at the age of sixty-six, he burst onto the literary scene with Angela's Ashes, the Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his childhood in Limerick, Ireland. Then came 'Tis, his glorious account of his early years in New York.<br /><br />Now, here at last, is McCourt's long-awaited book about how his thirty-year teaching career shaped his second act as a writer. Teacher Man is also an urgent tribute to teachers everywhere. In bold and spirited prose featuring his irreverent wit and heartbreaking honesty, McCourt records the trials, triumphs and surprises he faces in public high schools around New York City. His methods anything but conventional, McCourt creates a lasting impact on his students through imaginative assignments (he instructs one class to write ""An Excuse Note from Adam or Eve to God""), singalongs (featuring recipe ingredients as lyrics), and field trips (imagine taking twenty-nine rowdy girls to a movie in Times Square!).<br /><br />McCourt struggles to find his way in the classroom and spends his evenings drinking with writers and dreaming of one day putting his own story to paper. Teacher Man shows McCourt developing his unparalleled ability to tell a great story as, five days a week, five periods per day, he works to gain the attention and respect of unruly, hormonally charged or indifferent adolescents. McCourt's rocky marriage, his failed attempt to get a Ph.D. at Trinity College, Dublin, and his repeated firings due to his propensity to talk back to his superiors ironically lead him to New York's most prestigious school, Stuyvesant High School, where he finally finds a place and a voice. ""Doggedness,"" he says, is ""not as glamorous as ambition or talent or intellect or charm, but still the one thing that got me through the days and nights.""<br /><br />For McCourt, storytelling itself is the source of salvation, and in Teacher Man the journey to redemption -- and literary fame -- is an exhilarating adventure."
' Tis: a Memoir,,Frank McCourt,eng,1779262,,,,44664,Frank McCourt,2,"The sequel to Frank McCourt's memoir of his Irish Catholic boyhood, <i>Angela's Ashes</i>, picks up the story in October 1949, upon his arrival in America. Though he was born in New York, the family had returned to Ireland due to poor prospects in the United States. Now back on American soil, this awkward 19-year-old, with his ""pimply face, sore eyes, and bad teeth,"" has little in common with the healthy, self-assured college students he sees on the subway and dreams of joining in the classroom. Initially, his American experience is as harrowing as his impoverished youth in Ireland, including two of the grimmest Christmases ever described in literature. McCourt views the U.S. through the same sharp eye and with the same dark humor that distinguished his first memoir: race prejudice, casual cruelty, and dead-end jobs weigh on his spirits as he searches for a way out. A glimpse of hope comes from the army, where he acquires some white-collar skills, and from New York University, which admits him without a high school diploma. But the journey toward his position teaching creative writing at Stuyvesant High School is neither quick nor easy.

His exploration of faith, doubt, morality, and the place of suffering in life are equaled in no other work of literature, save the Bible. // The book explores the possible role of four brothers in the unresolved murder of their father, Fyodor Karamazov. At the same, it carefully explores the personalities and inclinations of the brothers themselves. Their psyches together represent the full spectrum of human nature, and continuum of faith and doubt. Ultimately this novel seeks to understand the real meaning of existence and includes much beneficial philosophical and spiritual discussion that moves the reader towards faith. // This new abridgment done exclusively for Hovel Audio by Russian Studies scholar Thomas Beyer keeps the important religious themes of the novel intact. It is an excellent way for the admirer of Dostoevsky to refresh himself, or to introduce Dostoevsky to a friend who has yet to experience the joy of reading his works. // Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1881) writes with a passion and keen insight of biblical grace like no other modern novelist. His works Crime and Punishment and The Idiot testify to his great skill. The Brothers Karamazov has been hailed by readers for over a century as one of the finest achievements in all of western literature. // Thomas R.

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,,Dave Eggers,eng,42857,,Vintage,485,,,,"'When you read his extraordinary memoir you don't laugh, then cry, then laugh again; you somehow experience these emotions all at once.'<br /><br />""Well, this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter. So when something would come up, any little thing, some bill to pay or decision to make, he would just sigh, his eyes tired, his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. <br /><br />But Beth and I...Jesus, we were fighting with everyone, anyone, each other, with strangers at bars, anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration, a kind of arrogance born of fatalism, I guess, of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month, then basically anything could happen, at any time -- all bullets bear your name, all cars are there to crush you, any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. <br /><br />And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour. This was San Francisco, you know, and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean, wicca? -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the Real World tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean, when we drive, Toph and I, and we drive past people, standing on top of all these hills, part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation, and part of me wants to run them all over."""

A Monk Swimming,,Malachy McCourt,,144094,,Hachette Books,290,,,,"Slapped with a libel suit after an appearance on a talk show, Malachy McCourt crows, ""If they could only see me now in the slums of Limerick, a big shot, sued for a million. Bejesus, isn't America a great and wonderful country?"" His older brother Frank's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, <em>Angela's Ashes</em>, took its somber tone from the bleak atmosphere of those slums, while Malachy's boisterous recollections are fueled by his zestful appreciation for the opportunities and oddities of his native land. He and Frank were born in Brooklyn, moved with their parents to Ireland as children, then returned to the States as adults. This book covers the decade 1952-63, when Malachy roistered across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but spent most of his time in New York City. There his ready wit and quick tongue won him an acting job with the Irish Players, a semiregular stint on <em>The Tonight Show</em> hosted by Jack Paar, and friendships with some well-heeled, well-born types who shared his fondness for saloon life and bankrolled him in an East Side saloon that may have been the first singles bar. He chronicles those events--and many others--with back-slapping bonhomie. Although McCourt acknowledges the personal demons that pursued him from his poverty-stricken childhood and destroyed his first marriage, this is on the whole an exuberant autobiography that pays tribute to the joys of a freewheeling life."

The basic concept of a separate middle school was to better focus on and serve the special needs of children in their early teens. The question is whether middle schools, as currently designed and operated, are performing that function well. Or, as some have alleged, do they unintentionally encourage poor behavior, alienation, disengagement, and low achievement? This monograph is a comprehensive assessment of the American middle school. It presents observations on a variety of very real issues--troubling social climates and associated behavioral problems, teachers who lack subject-matter expertise, and parents who seem uninvolved, among others. The authors offer ways of tackling these issues: reassessing the organization of grades K-12; specifically assisting the students most in need; finding ways to prevent disciplinary problems; working with proven professional-development models; helping parents understand the school's goals and methods and how they can help their children learn at home; and exploring how other countries promote the well-being of and provide positive school climates for students of comparable age to support academic achievement.

The Red Tent,,Anita Diamant,eng,1041558,,St. Martin's Press,324,,,,"Her name is Dinah. In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that are about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood—the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers—Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah—the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting, <i>The Red Tent</i> combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society."
Inside the Red Tent,,Sandra Hack Polaski,eng,8528,,Chalice Press,100,,,,"The story of Dinah receives little more than a mention in the Bible, as it gives rise to a bloody massacre. Not so with Anita Diamant's The Red Tent (Picador 1998). Diamant weaves ancient history and culture with narrative fiction to draw a picture of what life might have been like for the women in Jacob's life. With skill and passion, Sandra Hack Polaski unravels the complexities of the biblical stories of Leah, Rachel, Zil'pah, Bil'hah, and Leah's daughter Dinah, probing aspects of The Red Tent that give us insight into the text and into the lives of women in the ancient Near East. Inside the Red Tent brings readers into the biblical and historical contexts of the world of Dinah and her four mothers, exploring their stories through the tradition of midrash, sound biblical scholarship, and archeological findings. She gives us a glimpse ""inside the red tent"" at the families, relationships, encounters, goddesses, and God that defined their lives and that define ours. From the Popular Insights series."

Única hija mujer de Jacob entre los numerosos varones que éste tuvo con Lía, su primera mujer, y con sus otras tres esposas, Zilpá, Raquel y Bilhá, todas ellas hijas de Labán, Diná relata de viva voz su propia historia en lo que supone una auténtica evocación del mundo femenino en la época del Antiguo Testamento. En aquellos tiempos, las tradiciones, las historias familiares y los conocimientos en general se perpetuaban de generación en generación por medio del linaje materno. Y el trasvase de toda esta sabiduría tenía lugar en la «tienda roja», espacio donde se recluían las mujeres cuando no podían aparecer ante los ojos de los hombres, durante los días del ciclo femenino, después de los partos y en momentos de enfermedad. Allí, Diná explicará las historias de sus «cuatro madres», a partir del día en que Jacob apareció en las tierras de su tío Labán, así como el azaroso traslado de su familia desde la Mesopotamia hasta Canaán, y más tarde su emigración a Egipto.<br />Pero La tienda roja no es simplemente una reconstrucción del libro del Génesis desde el punto de vista de la mujer, sino una novela histórica minuciosamente investigada que nos introduce en el riquísimo mundo de las tradiciones más ancestrales. Todo un acopio de normas y conductas imprescindibles para la supervivencia en tierras áridas y desoladas que, además de constituir la base de las religiones judeocristianas, siguen vigentes en algunos rincones del mundo hasta el día de hoy."
Girl With A Pearl Earring,,Tracy Chevalier,en-US,3358875,,,,,,,"With precisely 35 canvases to his credit, the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries - and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.<br /><i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model."

The author dug up the facts and has arranged them to show in great detail how brilliant Dr. J. W. Peacock ambushed the young, arrogant police chief, John Taylor, on a busy downtown street in Thomasville, a small North Carolina factory town. The doctor finished him off with a World War I souvenir, a German Luger. The doctor, also a city councilman, and the chief began feuding after the chief decided to crackdown on those, like the doctor, who ignored the laws against gambling and drinking. The feud became unbelievably bitter and explosive. By the time of the attack downtown, the doctor had been convinced, ""It's either him or me."" In a trial that featured the best legal minds in North Carolina, the doctor barely escaped the electric chair. Then, a year later, he escaped a prison for the criminally insane. He managed to outrun them all. Only a horrible accident in California could rob him of his freedom."

Saturday,,Ian McEwan,eng,2307189,,Anchor,289,,,,"Saturday is a masterful novel set within a single day in February 2003. Henry Perowne is a contented man — a successful neurosurgeon, happily married to a newspaper lawyer, and enjoying good relations with his children. Henry wakes to the comfort of his large home in central London on this, his day off. He is as at ease here as he is in the operating room. Outside the hospital, the world is not so easy or predictable. There is an impending war against Iraq, and a general darkening and gathering pessimism since the New York and Washington attacks two years before.<br /><br />On this particular Saturday morning, Perowne's day moves through the ordinary to the extraordinary. After an unusual sighting in the early morning sky, he makes his way to his regular squash game with his anaesthetist, trying to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marchers filling the streets of London, protesting against the war. A minor accident in his car brings him into a confrontation with a small-time thug. To Perowne's professional eye, something appears to be profoundly wrong with this young man, who in turn believes the surgeon has humiliated him — with savage consequences that will lead Henry Perowne to deploy all his skills to keep his family alive."

But when Eliza sweeps her school and district spelling bees in quick succession, Saul takes it as a sign that she is destined for greatness.

When Miriam's secret life triggers a familial explosion, it is Eliza who must order the chaos.<br /><br />Myla Goldberg's keen eye for detail brings Eliza's journey to three-dimensional life. As she rises from classroom obscurity to the blinding lights and outsized expectations of the National Bee, Eliza's small pains and large joys are finely wrought and deeply felt.<br /><br />Not merely a coming-of-age story, Goldberg's first novel delicately examines the unraveling fabric of one family.

The Truth about the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do about It,,Marcia Angell,en-GB,8592,,Random House Trade,319,,,,"During her two decades at <i>The</i> <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, Dr. Marcia Angell had a front-row seat on the appalling spectacle of the pharmaceutical industry. She watched drug companies stray from their original mission of discovering and manufacturing useful drugs and instead become vast marketing machines with unprecedented control over their own fortunes. She saw them gain nearly limitless influence over medical research, education, and how doctors do their jobs. She sympathized as the American public, particularly the elderly, struggled and increasingly failed to meet spiraling prescription drug prices. Now, in this bold, hard-hitting new book, Dr. Angell exposes the shocking truth of what the pharmaceutical industry has become–and argues for essential, long-overdue change.<br /><br />Currently Americans spend a staggering $200 billion each year on prescription drugs. As Dr. Angell powerfully demonstrates, claims that high drug prices are necessary to fund research and development are unfounded: The truth is that drug companies funnel the bulk of their resources into the marketing of products of dubious benefit. Meanwhile, as profits soar, the companies brazenly use their wealth and power to push their agenda through Congress, the FDA, and academic medical centers.<br /><br />Zeroing in on hugely successful drugs like AZT (the first drug to treat HIV/AIDS), Taxol (the best-selling cancer drug in history), and the blockbuster allergy drug Claritin, Dr. Angell demonstrates exactly how new products are brought to market. Drug companies, she shows, routinely rely on publicly funded institutions for their basic research; they rig clinical trials to make their products look better than they are; and they use their legions of lawyers to stretch out government-granted exclusive marketing rights for years. They also flood the market with copycat drugs that cost a lot more than the drugs they mimic but are no more effective.<br /><br />The American pharmaceutical industry needs to be saved, mainly from itself, and Dr. Angell proposes a program of vital reforms, which includes restoring impartiality to clinical research and severing the ties between drug companies and medical education. Written with fierce passion and substantiated with in-depth research, <i>The Truth About the Drug Companies</i> is a searing indictment of an industry that has spun out of control."

The Truth about the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do about It,,Marcia Angell,,8592,,Books on Tape,,,,,"In this explosive expose of the drug companies and how they are ripping us off, Marcia Angell, M.D., a doctor, medical journalist, and a former editor of the respected New England Journal of Medicine, reveals the many ways in which the pharmaceutical industry has moved away from its original purpose of finding and producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine that produces drugs of questionable benefit, the industry uses its wealth and power to co-opt such institutions as the U.S. Congress, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), academic medical centers, as well as the medical profession. In spite of a lack of innovative drugs and continuously growing prices, the drug companies invest most of their time and money in marketing, legal maneuvers to extend patient rights, and government lobbying to prevent price regulation."

She knows that the Germans’ ability to thwart the Allied attack depends upon their lines of communications, and in the days before the invasion no target is of greater strategic importance than the largest telephone exchange in Europe.<br /><br />But when Flick and her Resistance-leader husband try a direct, head-on assault that goes horribly wrong, her world turns upside down.

Here All Dwell Free: Stories to Heal the Wounded Feminine,,Gertrud Mueller Nelson,,8626,,Paulist Press,384,,,,"Every human being lives a fairy tale -- an unconscious myth that works on us, shapes us, and points to our truth. Often the story is filled with danger and foreboding. The good news is, for those who examine it closely, the story also carries with it balm and healing. 'Here All Dwell Free' is an in-depth exploration of two classic fairy tales that have particular significance for women. The Handless Maiden will resonate in a special way with women who feel powerless in the contemporary world. In a similar way, Briar Rose is about falling asleep and waking, of abandonment and allowing oneself to be discovered by love. While the stories recounted here may be ancient, they speak to us today in unmistakable symbolic language, inviting us to enter them, live them, and be made whole again. . . . A wonderful book which brings hope and healing to the urgency of our broken world. -- Robert Johnson Concerned with the inner development of women as well as the repressed feminine in men, Nelson finds her guidelines in the archetypal truth that resides in familiar fairy tales. -- 'San Diego Magazine' Gertrud Mueller Nelson is an artist, writer, lecturer, and educator.

She may go out once a day to markets whose signs are now pictures because women are not allowed to read. She must pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, for in a time of declining birthrates her value lies in her fertility, and failure means exile to the dangerously polluted Colonies. Offred can remember a time when she lived with her husband and daughter and had a job, before she lost even her own name. Now she navigates the intimate secrets of those who control her every move, risking her life in breaking the rules. <br /><br />Like Aldous Huxley’s <i>Brave New World </i>and George Orwell’s <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Handmaid's Tale </i>has endured not only as a literary landmark but as a warning of a possible future that is still chillingly relevant."

Includes letters and lectures by Huxley never published elsewhere. In May 1953 Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gram of mescaline. The mystical and transcendent experience that followed set him off on an exploration that was to produce a revolutionary body of work about the inner reaches of the human mind. Huxley was decades ahead of his time in his anticipation of the dangers modern culture was creating through explosive population increase, headlong technological advance, and militant nationalism, and he saw psychedelics as the greatest means at our disposal to ""remind adults that the real world is very different from the misshapen universe they have created for themselves by means of their culture-conditioned prejudices."" Much of Huxley's writings following his 1953 mescaline experiment can be seen as his attempt to reveal the power of these substances to awaken a sense of the sacred in people living in a technological society hostile to mystical revelations. Moksha, a Sanskrit word meaning ""liberation,"" is a collection of the prophetic and visionary writings of Aldous Huxley. It includes selections from his acclaimed novels Brave New World and Island, both of which envision societies centered around the use of psychedelics as stabilizing forces, as well as pieces from The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell, his famous works on consciousness expansion."

""This is Mr. Huxley's Hollywood novel, and you might expect it to be fantastic, extravagant, crazy and preposterous. It is all that, and heaven and hell too....It is the kind of novel that he is particularly the master of, where the most extraordinary and fortuitous events are followed by contemplative little essays on the meaning of life....The story is outrageously good.""--New York Times. ""A highly sensational plot that will keep astonishing you to practically the final sentence.""--The New Yorker.

As pioneering settlers, they built a house of grass, ate off a damask cloth spread over packing cases, and discovered—the hard way—the world of the African. With an extraordinary gift for detail and a keen sense of humor, Huxley recalls her childhood on the small farm at a time when Europeans waged their fortunes on a land that was as harsh as it was beautiful. For a young girl, it was a time of adventure and freedom, and Huxley paints an unforgettable portrait of growing up among the Masai and Kikuyu people, discovering both the beauty and the terrors of the jungle, and enduring the rugged realities of the pioneer life."

The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,,Carson McCullers,eng,860196,Oprah's Book Club,Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin Company,359,,,,"With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER, Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty. Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness. She writes with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming, said the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation, but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best."

The tribulation, according to Grandpa Herman, founder of Fire and Brimstone, will be an ugly time: ""He said that we'd run out of food. That big bugs would chase us around and sting us with their tails . . . He said we'd turn on the faucet in the bathroom and find only blood running out . . .

Her eccentric mother tries to help by fixing her up with dates, but a more pressing problem is money. To meet her mortgage payments, Sam decides to take in boarders. The first is an older woman who offers sage advice and sorely needed comfort; the second, a maladjusted student, is not quite so helpful. A new friend, King, an untraditional man, suggests that Samantha get out, get going, get work. But her real work is this: In order to emerge from grief and the past, she has to learn how to make her own happiness. In order to really see people, she has to look within her heart. And in order to know who she is, she has to remember--and reclaim--the person she used to be, long before she became someone else in an effort to save her marriage. Open House is a love story about what can blossom between a man and a woman, and within a woman herself.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

""Tara Road,"" her first full-length novel since ""The Glass Lake,"" again shows her incomparable understanding of the human heart in the tale of two women, one from Ireland, one from America, who switch lives, and in doing so learn much about each other, as well as much about themselves. Ria lived on Tara Road in Dublin with her dashing husband, Danny, and their two children. She fully believed she was happily married, right up until the day Danny told her he was leaving her to be with his young, pregnant girlfriend. By a chance phone call, Ria meets Marilyn, a woman from New England unable to come to terms with her only son's death and now separated from her husband.

Marilyn seems to have become bosom friends with Ria's children, as well as with Colm, a handsome restaurateur, whom Ria has begun to miss terribly. At the end of the summer, the women at last meet face-to-face.

When the Goodwins took over the last dairy farm in the small Midwestern town of Prairie Center, they envisioned their home a self-made paradise. But these days, as Alice is all too aware, her elder daughter Emma is prone to inexplicable fits of rage, her husband Howard distrusts her maternal competence, and Prairie Center's tight-knit suburban community shows no signs of warming to ""those hippies who think they can run a farm."" <br /><br />A loner by nature, Alice is torn between a yearning for solitude coupled with a deep need to be at the center of a perfect family. On this particular day, Emma has started the morning with a violent tantrum, her little sister Claire is eating pennies, and it is Alice's turn to watch her neighbor's two small girls as well as her own. She absentmindedly steals a minute alone that quickly becomes ten: time enough for a devastating accident to occur. Her neighbor's daughter Lizzy drowns in the farm's pond, and Alice - whose own volatility and unmasked directness keep her on the outskirts of acceptance - becomes the perfect scapegoat. At the same time, a seemingly trivial incident from Alice's past resurfaces and takes on gigantic proportions, leading the Goodwins far from Lizzy's death into a maze of guilt and doubt culminating in a harrowing court trial and the family's shattering downfall."

Daughter of Fortune,"[{'id': '2238', 'name': 'Isabel Allende', 'role': ''}, {'id': '30209', 'name': 'Margaret Sayers Peden', 'role': 'Translator'}]",Isabel Allende,eng,3471915,,HarperCollins,399,297749,Del Valle Family,1,"<b>Oprah Book Club® Selection, February 2000:</b> Until Isabel Allende burst onto the scene with her 1985 debut, <i>The House of the Spirits</i>, Latin American fiction was, for the most part, a boys' club comprising such heavy hitters as Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario Vargas Llosa. But the Chilean Allende shouldered her way in with her magical realist multi-generational tale of the Trueba family, followed it up with four more novels and a spate of nonfiction, and has remained in a place of honor ever since. Her sixth work of fiction, <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>, shares some characteristics with her earlier works: the canvas is wide, the characters are multi-generational and multi-ethnic, and the protagonist is an unconventional woman who overcomes enormous obstacles to make her way in the world. Yet one cannot accuse Allende of telling the same story twice; set in the mid-1800s, this novel follows the fortunes of Eliza Sommers, Chilean by birth but adopted by a British spinster, Rose Sommers, and her bachelor brother, Jeremy, after she is abandoned on their doorstep. <blockquote> ""You have English blood, like us,"" Miss Rose assured Eliza when she was old enough to understand. ""Only someone from the British colony would have thought to leave you in a basket on the doorstep of the British Import and Export Company, Limited. I am sure they knew how good-hearted my brother Jeremy is, and felt sure he would take you in. In those days I was longing to have a child, and you fell into my arms, sent by God to be brought up in the solid principles of the Protestant faith and the English language."" </blockquote> The family servant, Mama Fresia, has a different point of view, however: ""You, English? Don't get any ideas, child. You have Indian hair, like mine."" And certainly Eliza's almost mystical ability to recall all the events of her life would seem to stem more from the Indian than the Protestant side. <p> As Eliza grows up, she becomes less tractable, and when she falls in love with Joachin Andieta, a clerk in Jeremy's firm, her adoptive family is horrified. They are even more so when a now-pregnant Eliza follows her lover to California where he has gone to make his fortune in the 1849 gold rush. Along the way Eliza meets Tao Chi'en, a Chinese doctor who saves her life and becomes her closest friend. What starts out as a search for a lost love becomes, over time, the discovery of self; and by the time Eliza finally catches up with the elusive Joachin, she is no longer sure she still wants what she once wished for. Allende peoples her novel with a host of colorful secondary characters. She even takes the narrative as far afield as China, providing an intimate portrait of Tao Chi'en's past before returning to 19th-century San Francisco, where he and Eliza eventually fetch up. Readers with a taste for the epic, the picaresque, and romance that is satisfyingly complex will find them all in <i>Daughter of Fortune</i>. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p>"

Song of Solomon,,Toni Morrison,en-US,3215642,,Plume,337,,,,"In this celebrated novel, Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison created a new way of rendering the contradictory nuances of black life in America. Its earthy poetic language and striking use of folklore and myth established Morrison as a major voice in contemporary fiction. <br />""Song of Solomon"" begins with one of the most arresting scenes in our century's literature: a dreamlike tableau depicting a man poised on a roof, about to fly into the air, while cloth rose petals swirl above the snow-covered ground and, in the astonished crowd below, one woman sings as another enters premature labor. The child born of that labor, Macon (Milkman) Dead, will eventually come to discover, through his complicated progress to maturity, the meaning of the drama that marked his birth. Toni Morrison's novel is at once a romance of self-discovery, a retelling of the black experience in America that uncovers the inalienable poetry of that experience, and a family saga luminous in its depth, imaginative generosity, and universality. It is also a tribute to the ways in which, in the hands of a master, the ancient art of storytelling can be used to make the mysterious and invisible aspects of human life apparent, real, and firm to the touch."

The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism,,Paul Kengor,eng,8708,,Harper,432,,,,"Based on extraordinary research: a major reassessment of Ronald Reagan's lifelong crusade to dismantle the Soviet Empire–including shocking revelations about the liberal American politician who tried to collude with USSR to counter Reagan's efforts<br /><br />Paul Kengor's God and Ronald Reagan made presidential historian Paul Kengor's name as one of the premier chroniclers of the life and career of the 40th president. Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged–and ultimately triumphant–effort to overthrow the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan's efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the ""Evil Empire."" The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take––and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency.<br /><br />The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician–still in office today–in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan's 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan's policies were in the 1980s."
An American Life,,Ronald Reagan,eng,8709,,Gallery Books,,,,,"The former president relates the story of his public and private life from his modest beginnings in the Midwest, through a distinguished film career, to a second career in politics.<br />Ronald Reagan’s account of that rise is told here with all the uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit that made him perhaps the most able communicator ever to occupy the White House, and also with the sense of drama of a gifted natural storyteller. <br /><br />He tells us, with warmth and pride, of his early years and of the elements that made him, in later life, a leader of such stubborn integrity, courage, and clear-minded optimism. Reading the account of this childhood, we understand how his parents, struggling to make ends meet despite family problems and the rigors of the Depression, shaped his belief in the virtues of American life—the need to help others, the desire to get ahead and to get things done, the deep trust in the basic goodness, values, and sense of justice of the American people—virtues that few presidents have expressed more eloquently than Ronald Reagan."

With this two-volume set, The Library of America presents the finest of Wharton's achievement in short fiction: 67 stories drawn from the entire span of her writing life, including the novella-length works The Touchstone, Sanctuary, and Bunner Sisters, eight shorter pieces never collected by Wharton, and many stories long out-of-print.Her range of setting and subject matter is dazzling, and her mastery of style consistently sure. Here are all the aspects of Wharton's art: her satire, sometimes gentle, sometimes dark and despairing, of upper-class manners; her unblinking recognition of the power of social convention and the limits of passion; her merciless exposure of commercial motivations; her candid exploration of relations between the sexes.<br /><br />The stories range with cosmopolitan ease from her native New York to the salons and summer hotels of Newport, Paris, and the Italian lakes. The depth of her response to World War I is registered in such works as ""The Marne"". Of particular interest are the remarkable stories which treat occult and supernatural themes rarely encountered in her novels, such as the classic ghost stories ""The Eyes"" and ""Pomegranate Seed""."

She found there a microcosm of the sort of society that had always fascinated her, that she described in her classic novels. Between the two world wars, the whole region was a playground for film stars, magnates, and princesses: her neighbors included Wallis Simpson, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, and Dorothy Parker. For Edith Wharton, the Riviera was at once a haven where she could write to her heart's content, and a terrifyingly superficial world. <br />This fascinating book is a study of this world as it existed when Edith Wharton arrived, and how the region changed over the years. Richly illustrated with both contemporary and vintage photographs, it is a hugely evocative portrait of the Golden Age of the Riviera. Edith Wharton on the Riviera is a rare treat: a taste of the fabulous lifestyle of the privileged classes that has now vanished forever.<br />"

The Best Short Stories of Edith Wharton,,Edith Wharton,eng,8733,,Kessinger Publishing,300,,,,"Wharton, American author, is best known for her stories and ironic novels about upper class people. Wharton's central subjects were the conflict between social and individual fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners of old families and the nouveau riche, who had made their fortunes in more recent years. Among her numerous novels, short stories, and travel writings are The House of Mirth, Ethan Frome, and the Pulitzer prize-winning Age of Innocence. In this volume Wharton explores the anguish and hypocrisy hanging over the lives of divorced women in The Other Two, Souls Belated, Autres Temps and The Last Asset. In Roman Fever she points out that defiance is often the weakest defense for a woman. She takes gentle jabs at women's clubs in Xingu, an old snob in After Holbein and the musty odor of New England's Indian Summer in Angel at the Grave. No collection of Wharton's stories would be complete without one of her ghost stories, Pomegranate Seed being one of her best. And finally, in Bunner Sisters she reminds us that she occasionally strayed down streets where no calling cards were ever left. See other titles by this author available from Kessinger Publishing."

Oscar Wilde,,Richard Ellmann,eng,8755,,Vintage,736,,,,"The biography sensitive to the tragic pattern of the story of a great subject: Oscar Wilde - psychologically and sexually complicated, enormously quotable, central to an. alluring cultural world and someone whose life assumed an unbearably dramatic shape."
The Importance of Being Earnest,,Oscar Wilde,,649216,Acting Edition,Samuel French Ltd,114,,,,"The Importance of Being Earnest A Trivial Comedy for Serious People Oscar Wilde The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae in order to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work. The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions. In The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell; The Importance of Being Earnest (1992) by Kurt Baker used an all-black cast; and Oliver Parker's The Importance of Being Earnest (2002) incorporated some of Wilde's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production."
An Ideal Husband,,Oscar Wilde,eng,130598,,Dover Publications,78,,,,"Although Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) created a wide range of poetry, essays, and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.<br /><i>An Ideal Husband</i> revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards — providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.<br />Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. <i>An Ideal Husband</i> is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication."

The tale of Dorian Gray’s moral disintegration caused a scandal when it ﬁrst appeared in 1890, but though Wilde was attacked for the novel’s corrupting inﬂuence, he responded that there is, in fact, “a terrible moral in <i>Dorian Gray</i>.” Just a few years later, the book and the aesthetic/moral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wilde’s homosexual liaisons, which resulted in his imprisonment. Of Dorian Gray’s relationship to autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps."

Sharply observed, vivid, and dispassionate, it offers not only an unforgettable portrait of Wilde himself, his circle of friends, and his band of persecutors, but also a touching chronicle of Holland's own childhood, of the loneliness he experienced as the son of a remarkable, notorious father and of his emergence from the shadows of cruel injustice and dark scandal.

The Complete Short Stories of Oscar Wilde,,Oscar Wilde,,2064181,,Dover Publications,208,,,,"This comprehensive collection showcases Oscar Wilde's brilliant storytelling skills and his amazing stylistic versatility, ranging from fairy tales and ghost stories to detective yarns and comedies of manners. It includes the complete texts of ""The Happy Prince and Other Tales,"" ""A House of Pomegranates,"" ""Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories,"" ""Poems in Prose,""<i></i>and the critical essay ""The Portrait of Mr. W. H.""<br />Originally published in the late 1880s and early 1890s, these tales predate Wilde's fame as a dramatist. When he wrote them, he was best known among fashionable London society as a drawing-room raconteur. Many of the character types now familiar from his comedies first emerged in these stories, along with his gifted uses of parody, melodrama, paradox, and irony. Even more significantly, they reflect the author's preoccupation with opposites — idealistic love and desire, art and life, sincerity and artifice, innocence and sin, altruism and greed, and honesty and deceit — offering captivating expressions of the themes that dominated Wilde's life and thought."

In prose that blends the vernacular and the incantatory, the local and the mythic, these five works chart Steinbeck’s evolution into one of the greatest and most enduring popular of American novelists.<br /><br /><em>The Pastures of Heaven</em> (1932), a collection of interrelated stories, delineates the troubled inner lives and sometimes disastrous fates of families living in a seemingly tranquil California valley. The surface realism of Steinbeck’s first mature work is enriched by hints of uncanny forces at work beneath.<br /><br />“Deep down it’s mine, right to the center of the world,” says Salinas Valley farmer Joseph Wayne about his land in John Steinbeck’s <em>To a God Unknown</em> (1933). A sense of primeval magic dominates the novel as the farmer reverts to pagan nature worship and begins a tortuous journey toward catastrophe and ultimate understanding.<br /><br />Steinbeck’s sympathetic depiction of the raffish paisons of <em>Tortilla Flat</em> (1935), a ramshackle district above Monterey, first won him popular attention. The Flat’s tenderhearted, resourceful, mildly corrupt, over-optimistic characters are a triumph of life-affirming humor.<br /><br />In <em>Dubious Battle</em> (1936) plunges into the political struggle of the 1930s and paints a vigorous fresco of a migrant fruit-pickers’ strike. Anticipating the collective portraiture of The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck poignantly traces the surges and shifts of group behavior.<br /><br />With <em>Of Mice and Men</em> (1937), Steinbeck secured his status as one of the most influential American writers. Lennie and George, itinerant farmhands held together in the face of deprivation only by the frailest of dreams, have long since passed into American mythology. This novel, which Steinbeck called “such a simple little thing,” is now recognized as a masterpiece of concentrated emotional power."

Then, on a day like any other, Kino emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull’s egg, as “perfect as the moon.” With the pearl comes hope, the promise of comfort and of security…<br /><br />A story of classic simplicity, based on a Mexican folk tale, <i>The Pearl</i> explores the secrets of man’s nature, greed, the darkest depths of evil, and the luminous possibilities of love."

It's a very interesting idea to put a new text into an 'intertextual' relationship with a Dickens original. The treatment of the Jewish angle throws a sidelight on early C19th society and fictional representations of it at the time which is extremely interesting. I'm sure that many readers will find it fascinating . . . In short, a worthy endeavour with much that is thought-provoking."" --Charles Palliser<br /><br />""It's a brave soul who writes a sequel to a universally-loved and -known book like ""A Christmas Carol""; it's a rarer man still who does a job as fine as Marvin Kaye of evoking Charles Dickens without imitating him, of extending a story that had until now seemed resolved and delivering a tale which will delight, terrify and affect all readers."" --Kim Newman<br /><br />""I was impressed and moved on many levels-not only by Marvin Kaye's mastery of Dickensian style, but also by a kind of optimism, or idealism, far more consistent with Victorian Dickens/Kaye than with purely contemporary Kaye. I can imagine that Marvin really did write it as Dickens might have wanted it to go."" --Paula Volsky<br /><br />""This is a magical, indeed a miraculous, story.

A Christmas Carol,,Charles Dickens,eng,3097440,,Penguin Books,112,,,,"A Christmas Carol is a novella by English author Charles Dickens. It was first published by Chapman &amp; Hall on 19 December 1843.

The novella met with instant success and critical acclaim. The book was written and published in early Victorian era Britain, a period when there was strong nostalgia for old Christmas traditions together with the introduction of new customs, such as Christmas trees and greeting cards.

Hard Times,,Charles Dickens,eng,6751955,,Pearson Longman,353,,,,"""My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,"" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a ""fanatic of the demonstrable fact,"" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.<br /><br />Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.<br /><br />Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.<br /><br />Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: ""He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions."""

When he signed with the Oakland A's, he said goodbye to his hometown of Ada and left to pursue his dreams of big league glory. <br /><br />Six years later he was back, his dreams broken by a bad arm and bad habits—drinking, drugs, and women. He began to show signs of mental illness. Unable to keep a job, he moved in with his mother and slept twenty hours a day on her sofa. <br /><br />In 1982, a 21-year-old cocktail waitress in Ada named Debra Sue Carter was raped and murdered, and for five years the police could not solve the crime. For reasons that were never clear, they suspected Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. The two were finally arrested in 1987 and charged with capital murder. <br /><br />With no physical evidence, the prosecution's case was built on junk science and the testimony of jailhouse snitches and convicts. Dennis Fritz was found guilty and given a life sentence. Ron Williamson was sent to death row. <br /><br />If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you."

Forever Amber,,Kathleen Winsor,eng,2522906,,Penguin,972,,,,"Abandoned pregnant and penniless on the teeming streets of London, 16-year-old Amber St. Clare manages, by using her wits, beauty, and courage, to climb to the highest position a woman could achieve in Restoration England—that of favorite mistress of the Merry Monarch, Charles II. From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinary—and extraordinary—men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have. <br /><br />Frequently compared to <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, <i>Forever Amber</i> is the other great historical romance, outselling every other American novel of the 1940s—despite being banned in Boston for its sheer sexiness. A book to read and reread, this edition brings back to print an unforgettable romance and a timeless masterpiece."

Originally commissioned in 1701 by Frederick I of Prussia, the Room was later perfected Tsarskoe Selo, the Russian imperial city. In 1941, German troops invaded the Soviet Union, looting everything in their wake and seizing the Amber Room. When the Allies began the bombing of Germany in August 1944, the Room was hidden. And despite the best efforts of treasure hunters and art collectors from around the world, it has never been seen again."" <br />Now, two powerful men have set their best operatives loose in pursuit, and the hunt has begun once more. . . . <br />Life is good for Atlanta judge Rachel Cutler. She loves her job, loves her kids, and remains civil to her ex-husband, Paul. But everything changes when her father, a man who survived the horrors of World War II, dies under strange circumstances--and leaves behind clues to a secret he kept his entire life . . . a secret about something called the Amber Room. <br />Desperate to know the truth about her father's suspicious dealings, Rachel takes off for Germany, with Paul close behind. Shortly after arriving, they find themselves involved with a cast of shadowy characters who all claim to share their quest. But as they learn more about the history of the treasure they seek, Rachel and Paul realize they're in way over their heads. Locked in a treacherous game with ruthless professional killers and embroiled in a treasure hunt of epic proportions, Rachel and Paul suddenly find themselves on a collisioncourse with the forces of power, evil, and history itself. <br />A brilliant adventure and a scintillating tale of intrigue, deception, art, and murder, ""The Amber Room"" is a classic tale of suspense--and the debut of a strong new voice in the world of the international thriller.

Dangerous Knowledge: Orientalism and Its Discontents,,Robert Irwin,eng,8863,1st,Overlook,376,,,,"The publication of Edward Said's hugely influential <i>Orientalism</i> in 1981 called into question the entire history of the Western study of Islamic culture, condemning this scholarly tradition as one that presented inaccurate and deliberately demeaning representations of Islamic peoples and institutionsso much so that the words ""Oriental"" and ""Orientalist"" have come to take on the most negative connotations. <p>But what is Orientalism, and who were the Orientalists, and how did Western scholars of Islamic culture come to be vilified as insidious agents of European imperialism? In Robert Irwin's groundbreaking new history, he answers this question with a detailed and colorful story of the motley crew of intellectuals and eccentrics who brought an understanding of the Islamic world to the West. In a narrative that ranges from an analysis of Ancient Greek perceptions of the Persians to a portrait of the first Western European translators of Arabic to the contemporary Muslim world's perceptions of the Western study of Islam, Irwin affirms the value of the Orientalists' legacy: not only for the contemporary scholars who have disowned it, but also for anyone committed to fostering the cross-cultural understanding which could bridge the real or imagined gulf between Islamic and Western civilization. Dangerous Knowledge is a both riveting and entertaining history, a bold argument, and an urgent redress of our conceptions about Western culture's relationship with its nearest neighbor.</p>"

Richard King examines the way in which notions such as mysticism, religion, Hinduism and Buddhism are taken for granted. He shows us how religion needs to be reinterpreted along the lines of cultural studies. Drawing on a variety of post-structuralist and post-colonial thinkers, such as Foucault, Gadamer, Said, and Spivak, King provides us with a challenging series of reflections on the nature of Religious Studies and Indology."

Here he turns his eye to the wonders of the East and a series of interiors inspired by the colors and textures of Morocco, Byzantium, India, and beyond.Included in this book are interiors in Europe, North America, and North Africa belonging to the jet set and modern elite. Each interior celebrates opulence, whether with fine damasks and silks, intricate tilework, or glittering objets d'art.

Orientalism,,Alexander Lyon Macfie,,8867,,Routledge,200,,,,"At a crucial moment in the history of relations of East and West, Orient and Occident, Christianity and Islam, Orientalism provides a timely account of the subject and the debate.<br /><br /><br />In the 1960s and 1970s a powerful assault was launched on 'orientalism', led by Edward Said. The debate ranged far beyond the traditional limits of 'dry-as-dust' orientalism, involving questions concerning the nature of identity, the nature of imperialism, Islamophobia, myth, Arabism, racialism, intercultural relations and feminism.<br /><br /><br />Charting the history of the vigorous debate about the nature of orientalism, this timely account revisits the arguments and surveys the case studies inspired by that debate."
Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism,,Ibn Warraq,eng,8869,,Prometheus,556,,,,"This is the first systematic critique of Edward Said's influential work, Orientalism, a book that for almost three decades has received wide acclaim, voluminous commentary, and translation into more than fifteen languages. Said’s main thesis was that the Western image of the East was heavily biased by colonialist attitudes, racism, and more than two centuries of political exploitation. Although Said’s critique was controversial, the impact of his ideas has been a pervasive rethinking of Western perceptions of Eastern cultures, plus a tendency to view all scholarship in Oriental Studies as tainted by considerations of power and prejudice. <br /><br />In this thorough reconsideration of Said’s famous work, Ibn Warraq argues that Said’s case against the West is seriously flawed. Warraq accuses Said of not only willfully misinterpreting the work of many scholars, but also of systematically misrepresenting Western civilization as a whole. With example after example, he shows that ever since the Greeks Western civilization has always had a strand in its very makeup that has accepted non-Westerners with open arms and has ever been open to foreign ideas. <br /><br />The author also criticizes Said for inadequate methodology, incoherent arguments, and a faulty historical understanding. He points out, not only Said’s tendentious interpretations, but historical howlers that would make a sophomore blush. <br /><br />Warraq further looks at the destructive influence of Said's study on the history of Western painting, especially of the 19th century, and shows how, once again, the epigones of Said have succeeded in relegating thousands of first-class paintings to the lofts and storage rooms of major museums. <br /><br />An extended appendix reconsiders the value of 18th- and 19th-century Orientalist scholars and artists, whose work fell into disrepute as a result of Said’s work."
Edward W. Said's Orientalism: A Critique,,Bharat Bhusan Mohanty,,8870,,Rawat Publications,286,,,,"The present work formulates a comprehensive critique on Edward W. Said's Orientalism, and underlines its contributions, issues and theoretical ramifications. The study, which is essentially interdisciplinary in nature, initiates a detailed discussion on the three major issues of Orientalism, viz., the problematics of representation', complicity of culture in imperialism', and the deconstruction of the Western construct of Islam'. It explores the complex theoretical contexts (political, cultural, epistemological, and humanistic) of Orientalism's undeclared privileging of a pluralistic culture. The work contributes, in a genuine sense, to a broader understanding of Orientalism as well as Said's intellectual and theoretical positions. It establishes the greater relevance of reading Said in the context of current theoretical and political debates. The work also examines other major works of Said, such as Culture and Imperialism, Covering Islam, The Question of Palestine, etc., in the light of Orientalism."

In ""A Temporary Matter,"" published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant."

Take, for example, Shoba and Shukumar, the young couple in ""A Temporary Matter"" whose marriage is crumbling in the wake of a stillborn child. Or Miranda in ""Sexy,"" who is involved in a hopeless affair with a married man. But Mr. Kapasi has problems enough of his own; in addition to his regular job working as an interpreter for a doctor who does not speak his patients' language, he also drives tourists to local sites of interest. His fare on this particular day is Mr. and Mrs. Das--first-generation Americans of Indian descent--and their children. During the course of the afternoon, Mr. Kapasi becomes enamored of Mrs. Das and then becomes her unwilling confidant when she reads too much into his profession. ""I told you because of your talents,"" she informs him after divulging a startling secret. <blockquote> I'm tired of feeling so terrible all the time. Eight years, Mr. Kapasi, I've been in pain eight years. I was hoping you could help me feel better; say the right thing. Suggest some kind of remedy. </blockquote> Of course, Mr. Kapasi has no cure for what ails Mrs. Das--or himself. Lahiri's subtle, bittersweet ending is characteristic of the collection as a whole. Some of these nine tales are set in India, others in the United States, and most concern characters of Indian heritage. Yet the situations Lahiri's people face, from unhappy marriages to civil war, transcend ethnicity. As the narrator of the last story, ""The Third and Final Continent,"" comments: ""There are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept."" In that single line Jhumpa Lahiri sums up a universal experience, one that applies to all who have grown up, left home, fallen in or out of love, and, above all, experienced what it means to be a foreigner, even within one's own family. <i>--Alix Wilber</i><br /><br /><br />Interpreter of Maladies unerringly charts the emotional journeys of characters seeking love beyond the barriers of nations and generations. In sotries that travel from India to America and back again, Lahiri speaks with universal eloquence to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner."

The book is organized around four major themes, each with an introduction. The first section includes journal excerpts and letters revealing Franklin’s personal tastes and habits. The second is devoted to Franklin’s inexhaustible intellectual energy and his scientific discoveries. The third and fourth chronicle his devotion to serving the people who became the United States both before and after the Revolution and to advancing his democratic vision of their future.

The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted imply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.

Andrew Carnegie,,David Nasaw,eng,8905,,"Penguin Press HC, The",896,,,,"Majestically told and based on materials not available to any previous biographer, the definitive life of Andrew Carnegie-one of American business's most iconic and elusive titans-by the bestselling author of <i>The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst</i>. <br /><br /> Celebrated historian David Nasaw, whom <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> has called ""a meticulous researcher and a cool analyst,"" brings new life to the story of one of America's most famous and successful businessmen and philanthropists- in what will prove to be the biography of the season. <br /><br /> Born of modest origins in Scotland in 1835, Andrew Carnegie is best known as the founder of Carnegie Steel. His rags to riches story has never been told as dramatically and vividly as in Nasaw's new biography. Carnegie, the son of an impoverished linen weaver, moved to Pittsburgh at the age of thirteen. The embodiment of the American dream, he pulled himself up from bobbin boy in a cotton factory to become the richest man in the world. He spent the rest of his life giving away the fortune he had accumulated and crusading for international peace. For all that he accomplished and came to represent to the American public-a wildly successful businessman and capitalist, a self-educated writer, peace activist, philanthropist, man of letters, lover of culture, and unabashed enthusiast for American democracy and capitalism-Carnegie has remained, to this day, an enigma. <br /><br /> Nasaw explains how Carnegie made his early fortune and what prompted him to give it all away, how he was drawn into the campaign first against American involvement in the Spanish-American War and then for international peace, and how he used his friendships with presidents and prime ministers to try to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. <br /><br /> With a trove of new material-unpublished chapters of Carnegie's <i>Autobiography</i>; personal letters between Carnegie and his future wife, Louise, and other family members; his prenuptial agreement; diaries of family and close friends; his applications for citizenship; his extensive correspondence with Henry Clay Frick; and dozens of private letters to and from presidents Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and British prime ministers Gladstone and Balfour, as well as friends Herbert Spencer, Matthew Arnold, and Mark Twain-Nasaw brilliantly plumbs the core of this facinating and complex man, deftly placing his life in cultural and political context as only a master storyteller can."
Carnegie,,Peter Krass,,8906,,John Wiley & Sons,612,,,,"One of the major figures in American history, Andrew Carnegie was a ruthless businessman who made his fortune in the steel industry and ultimately gave most of it away. He used his wealth to ascend the world's political stage, influencing the presidencies of Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt. In retirement, Carnegie became an avid promoter of world peace, only to be crushed emotionally by World War I.<br />In this compelling biography, Peter Krass reconstructs the complicated life of this titan who came to power in America's Gilded Age. He transports the reader to Carnegie's Pittsburgh, where hundreds of smoking furnaces belched smoke into the sky and the air was filled with acrid fumes . . . and mill workers worked seven-day weeks while Carnegie spent months traveling across Europe.<br />Carnegie explores the contradictions in the life of the man who rose from lowly bobbin boy to build the largest and most profitable steel company in the world. Krass examines how Carnegie became one of the greatest philanthropists ever known-and earned a notorious reputation that history has yet to fully reconcile with his remarkable accomplishments."

At a deeper level, the book is an allegory whose heroes relive the lives of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Moses, Jesus and Muhammed. Their appearance in a modern context invites the reader to see them as human beings relevant to the present day, not as remote sacred figures - to the consternation of some traditionalists. Most controversial is the significance of Gebelaawi, the immensely long-lived patriarch. Mahfouz himself has said that his character represents 'not God, but a certain idea of God that men have made', standing for the god of those who forget the absolute transcendence of God affirmed by Islam."

I don't believe any autobiography, with its inevitable implication of self-presentation, could have matched what we have here.""<br /><br />With more than 500,000 copies of his books in print, Naguib Mahfouz has established a following of readers for whom <i>Echoes of an Autobiography</i> provides a unique opportunity to catch an intimate glimpse into the life and mind of this magnificent storyteller.  Here, in his first work of nonfiction ever to be published in the United States, Mahfouz considers the myriad perplexities of existence, including preoccupations with old age, death, and life's transitory nature.  A surprising and delightful departure from his bestselling and much-loved fiction, this unusual and thoughtful book is breathtaking evidence of the fact that Naguib Mahfouz is not only a ""storyteller of the first order"" (<i>Vanity Fair</i>), but also a profound  thinker of the first order."

Generation after generation, however, Ashur's descendants grow further from his legendary example. They lose touch with their origins as they amass and then squander large fortunes, marry prostitutes when they marry at all, and develop rivalries that end in death. <br /><br />The community's upper class keeps a watchful eye on the descendants of al-Nagi for fear of losing their privileges, but they find no threat of another such as Ashur. Not, that is, until the al-Nagi who, like his noble ancestor, finds his power once again from among ""The Harafish,"" or the common people. Through the strength of their numbers and their passion, the glory of the name of al-Nagi is restored."

Set against this backdrop, <b>The Day the Leader Was Killed</b> relates the tale of a middle-class Cairene family. Rich with irony and infused with political undertones, the story is narrated alternately by the pious and mischievous family patriarch Muhtashimi Zayed, his hapless grandson Elwan, and Elwan's headstrong and beautiful fiancee Randa.  The novel reaches its climax with the assassination of Sadat on October 6, 1981, an event around which the fictional plot is skillfully woven. <br /><br /><b>The Day the Leader Was Killed</b> brings us the essence of Mahfouz's genius and is further proof that he has, in the words of the Nobel citation, ""formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind."""

A group of lifelong friends meet to trade jokes in a familiar alley - only to face a sudden, deadly flood that echoes the revenge taken by an ancient Egyptian queen upon the men who murdered her husband. A girl from the dreamer's childhood flies with him from his native lane on a cart drawn by a winged horse, to become a star in the firmament above the Great Pyramid.Such is the stuff of Naguib Mahfouz's The Dreams - his first major work since a knife attack by a religious fanatic in 1994 left him unable to write for several years. First serialized in a Cairo magazine, The Dreams is a unique and haunting mixture of the deceptively quotidian, the seductively lyrical, and the savagely nightmarish - the richly condensed sum of more than nine decades of artistic genius and everyday experience."
The Seventh Heaven: Stories of the Supernatural,,Naguib Mahfouz,,8925,,American University in Cairo Press,151,,,,"Naguib Mahfouz, famed for his uncanny power to depict the real world, is equally ingenious at capturing the surreal, the otherworldly, and the supernatural. The ghostly side of Mahfouz's fiction, though less well known than his other works, nonetheless remains a haunting presence. This collection of stories sifted from his later writings brings these restless spirits out of the Mahfouzian shadows together for the first time in English: A murdered man finds himself in the first level of what he mistakes for Paradise - where he faces, along with historical figures such as Akhenaten, Woodrow Wilson, and Gamal Abd al-Nasser, a strange system of earthly probation that may (or may not) get him to the fabled Seventh Heaven. A teenager is warned not to go near the allegedly haunted wood in his neighborhood, only to be drawn into the secret, enchanted life he finds within it. An honest perfume seller is accosted on a night out by angry skeletons, who threaten to march upon his alley as an avenging army if the sinners there do not change their ways. Satan speaks to us directly - to confess that there is still, despite the flood of evil in our times, an honorable man in the land. These and the other startling stories in The Seventh Heaven make a vivid contribution to the translated works of Egypt's - and the Arab world's - greatest modern author."

This interdisciplinary collection of commentary and forty-five primary documents will enrich the reader's understanding of the historical and social context of the play. A wide variety of primary materials sheds light on integration and segregation in the 1950s and 1960s; relationships between African Americans and Africans; relationships between men and women within African American culture; Chicago as a literary setting for the play; and contemporary race relations in the 1990s. Documents include first-person accounts, magazine articles and editorials espousing opposing arguments, excerpts from the works of Toni Morrison, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, bell hooks, Malcolm X, and Richard Wright, and a selection of pertinent government documents and eye-opening statistics. Many of the documents are available in no other printed form.

Two chapters on the historical context provide commentary and documents on the history of segregation and integration in the United States, focusing on segregation in employment and education as well as in housing, and relationships between African Americans and Africans and the back to Africa movement. A chapter situates the play within the context of the literature of Chicago, including articles about race problems, as well as excerpts from Upton Sinclair's <i> The Jungle</i>, Richard Wright's <i>Native Son</i>, Carl Sandburg's poem Chicago, and other pieces. The topic of the relationship between African American men and women is explored in a variety of articles on the African American family, black fatherhood, black masculinity, and the problems of African American women. A chapter on contemporary race relations examines the current situation and includes first-person accounts by two African American teenagers, current employment statistics for African Americans, and articles on current problems facing them.

Drama Kings: The Men Who Drive Strong Women Crazy,,Dalma Heyn,,996732,,Rodale Books,224,,,,"In her newest book, the best-selling author of The Erotic Silence of the American Wife examines a rising trend in today's relationships—the coupling of high-achieving women with weaker men she terms ""drama kings,"" who are drawn to the women's strength but ultimately attempt to sabotage it. These men create chaos in relationships, driving women crazy in the process. Weaving examples from history, literature, and popular culture with clinical research she has conducted over several decades, Heyn details the telling traits of drama kings—and arms women with strategies to extricate themselves from these toxic relationships."

Byrne', 'role': ''}, {'id': '3769', 'name': 'Mike Barnicle', 'role': ''}]",Jack Welch,eng,6529222,,,496,,,,"As CEO of General Electric for the past twenty years, he has built its market cap by over $500 billion and established himself as the most admired business leader in the world. His championing of initiatives like Six Sigma quality, globalization, and e-business have helped define the modern corporation. At the same time, he's a gutsy boss who has forged a unique philosophy and an operating system that relies on a ""boundaryless"" sharing of ideas, an intense focus on people, and an informal, give-and-take style that makes bureaucracy the enemy.<br /><br />In anecdotal detail and with self-effacing humor, Jack Welch gives us the people (most notably his Irish mother) who shaped his life and the big hits and the big misses that characterized his career. Starting at GE in 1960 as an engineer earning $10,500, Jack learned the need for ""getting out of the pile"" when his first raise was the same as everyone else's. He stayed out of the corporate bureaucracy while running a $2 billion collection of GE businesses-in a sweater and blue jeans-out of a Hilton in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.<br /><br />After avoiding GE's Fairfield, Connecticut headquarters for years, Jack was eventually summoned by then Chairman Reg Jones, who was planning his succession. There ensued one of the most painful parts of his career-Jack's dark-horse struggle, filled with political tension, to make it to the CEO's chair. A hug from Reg confirmed Jack was the new boss-and started the GE transformation.<br /><br />Welch walks us through the ""Neutron Jack"" years, when GE's employment rolls fell by more than 100,000 as part of a strategy to ""fix, sell, or close"" each business-and how he used the purchase of RCA to provide a foundation for the company's future earnings.<br /><br />There were mistakes, too-and Jack confronts them openly. In ""Too Full of Myself,"" he describes one of the biggest blunders: the purchase of Kidder Peabody, which ran counter to GE's culture.<br /><br />The riveting story of his last year-the elaborate process of selecting a successor and the attempt to buy Honeywell-is also told in compelling detail.<br /><br />This book is laced with refreshing interludes, such as ""A Short Reflection on Golf,"" that capture Jack's competitiveness and the importance of friendship in his life. JACK: STRAIGHT FROM THE GUT is destined to become both a business classic and a deeply personal journey filled with passion and a sheer lust for life."
Jack: Straight from the Gut,"[{'id': '3770', 'name': 'Jack Welch', 'role': ''}, {'id': '3768', 'name': 'John A. Byrne', 'role': ''}, {'id': '3769', 'name': 'Mike Barnicle', 'role': 'Narrated by'}]",Jack Welch,,6529222,Unabridged: 10 Cassettes / 14.25 hour,Recorded Books,14,,,,"<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br /><br />During his 21-year tenure as chairman and chief executive of General Electric, Jack Welch redefined business culture in America and across the globe. Today, Welch epigrams like ""Fix, sell, or close"" are part of our everyday vocabulary; Welch initiatives like Six Sigma have enabled many organizations to meet the demands of a highly competitive marketplace; and Welch disciples hold leadership positions throughout the Fortune 500. In <i>Jack: Straight from the Gut,</i> the first book ever written by GE's legendary CEO, you'll find out how a chemical engineer impatient with bureaucracy took a solidly prosperous company and remade it into an extremely profitable, aggressive, value-oriented business that serves as a model for executives from New York to New Delhi. <br /><p><br />The first section of Welch's narrative deals with his childhood (the fierce passion and integrity of his mother, Grace  who refused to allow her son's stutter to stand in his way  resonate throughout the book), his formative experiences as he struggled to climb ""out of the pile"" while developing a new plastic called PPO for GE, and his ultimate accession  after two decades of hard work  to the post of chairman. As he recounts his rise through the ranks, Welch shares the principles that he believes were integral to his success. First and foremost is his commitment to creating a meritocracy in which the best people, those who truly distinguish themselves through the quality of their work, are rewarded: Nothing is as important as identifying, training, and holding on to talented people. Another core principle of Welch's is the need for speed and responsiveness; ""I wanted the company,"" he writes, ""to be more like a speedboat, fast and agile, able to turn on a dime."" A third principle could be called ""informality"" or even ""joy."" As a manager, Welch loved the back-and-forth involved in a true exchange of ideas as well as the conviviality of a night out celebrating the latest victory with his team. <br /></p><p><br />The second part of <i>Jack: Straight from the Gut</i> centers around Welch's resoundingly successful and sometimes painful struggle to modify GE's ""hardware"" (some business units were sold off or restructured while others, like NBC, were acquired) and its ""social architecture"" (the culture or values that drove the company). During this period, Welch revitalized Crotonville, GE's famous management training center, and introduced the revolutionary concept of ""boundaryless"" thinking into the organization. Welch tells us, ""The boundaryless company I saw would remove all barriers among the functions: engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and the rest.... It would eliminate the less visible walls of race and gender. It would put the team ahead of the individual ego."" The third and final section of the book discusses GE's four top initiatives over the past decade  globalization, the growth of services, Six Sigma, and digitalization  and also includes a pithy chapter entitled ""What This CEO Thing Is All About,"" in which Welch distills the lessons of his amazing career. Throughout the latter part of the book, Welch also deals candidly with some of his most highly publicized problems, including the response to the layoffs of the '80s; his difficulties with the acquisition of Kidder, Peabody; and the Hudson River PCB problem.<br /></p><p><br />Always enlightening and informative, <i>Jack: Straight from the Gut</i> offers us an invaluable look into the mind of the man whom <i>Business Week</i> calls ""the most impressive CEO of his time."" Although Welch doesn't portray himself as General Electric's savior (throughout the book, he generously acknowledges the contributions of his colleagues, thereby remaining true to his vision of team spirit), his book is essential reading for businesspeople and for anyone else who wants to understand the principles by which companies should be run. <i>(Sunil Sharma)</i></p><p><br /><br /><b>A Review by Janet Lowe</b><br /><br />The cover of Jack Welch's autobiography uncannily reflects what has recently come to pass at General Electric -- Jack has left the building. A relaxed, friendly, engaging Welch smiles directly into the camera -- the sweetest guy you'd ever meet now that he's retired. To see the toughest guy you would ever want to meet, the most competitive guy, the most ambitious guy, turn to the photos in the book's centerpiece. In one, a glowering Welch menacingly raises his fist to make a point. Each of these Welches is the real Welch -- they just represent who he was at different times and different places in his career. Now that Jack is no longer GE's chief executive officer, he can and does settle down for an honest, candid talk about his personal life and his remarkable 40-year career at General Electric.<br /></p><p><br />Despite the numerous volumes that have been written about him before, Welch's hot-off-the-press biography is worth every penny. True, many of the details of his life, such as his relationship with his mother, his management principles, and the selection of his successor, have been covered at length. But Welch and his coauthor, John A. Byrne, have done a yeoman's job of giving more colorful details, exploring ideas in depth, and infusing the book with Welch's snap, wit, and energy. <br /></p><p><br />The messages Welch hopes readers will get from the book are made clear by the words he uses over and over again -- passion, integrity, and his enormous respect for intellect. He becomes a little defensive when discussing GE's fight with the feds over polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination of the Hudson River. The chapter entitled ""Go Home, Mr. Welch,"" about the failed Honeywell merger, makes especially compelling reading. Students of business tactics will learn nearly as much from this failure as they will from his many king-sized successes.<br /></p><p> <br />Although it wasn't his goal to do so, Welch displays himself in this book as a uniquely American executive at the head of a thoroughly American company. His willingness to smash through all kinds of social, political, and economic barriers shows us that American ingenuity is alive and kicking -- in fact kicking hard. It also is clear (Welch says so himself) that he has been helped throughout his career by family, friends, teachers, bosses, and mentors who gave him chances to stretch and grow to his full potential. You might even say he enjoyed a lot of luck, unless you believe that most luck is nothing more than the convergence of brains, preparation and opportunity. If you want to know how this convergence works, read <i>Jack: Straight from the Gut</i>.<br /></p><p><br /><i><a href=""http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?author_last=lowe&amp;author_first=janet&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Janet Lowe</a> is the author of 17 business books, including biographies of business leaders Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, and most recently</i> <a href=""http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0471413356"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Welch: An American Icon</a>. <i>She is currently writing a book about champion mutual fund manager Bill Miller.</i></p>"

But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.<br /><br /><b>Waste equals food.</b><br /> <br />Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as ""biological nutrients"" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be ""technical nutrients"" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being ""recycled"" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well."

They tarred and feathered the backsides of British customs officials, gutted the mansion of Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson, armed themselves with marline spikes and cudgels to fight on the waterfront against soldiers of the British occupation, and hurled the contents of 350 chests of British East India Company tea into Boston Harbor under the very guns of the anchored British fleet.<br /><br />Cradle of Violence introduces the maritime workers who ignited the American Revolution: the fishermen desperate to escape impressment by Royal Navy press gangs, the frequently unemployed dockworkers, the wartime veterans and starving widows--all of whose mounting ""tumults"" led the way to rebellion. These were the hard-pressed but fiercely independent residents of Boston's North and South Ends who rallied around the Liberty Tree on Boston Common, who responded to Samuel Adams's cries against ""Tyranny,"" and whose headstrong actions helped embolden John Hancock to sign the Declaration of Independence. Without the maritime mobs' violent demonstrations against authority, the politicians would not have spurred on to utter their impassioned words; Great Britain would not have been provoked to send forth troops to quell the mob-induced rebellion; the War of Independence would not have happened.<br /><br />One of the mobs' most telling demonstrations brought about the Boston Massacre. After it, John Adams attempted to calm the town by dismissing the waterfront characters who had been killed as ""a rabble of saucy boys, negroes and mulattoes, Irish teagues, and outlandish jack tars.""

And it is the story of the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats, who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.

Death In The Afternoon,,Ernest Hemingway,,360058,,Scribner's Sons (NY),,,,,"Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and ""the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick."" Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning.<br /><br />A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature."
Death and Money in the Afternoon: A History of the Spanish Bullfight,,Adrian Shubert,,971593,,"Oxford University Press, USA",292,,,,"Bullfighting has long been perceived as an antiquated, barbarous legacy from Spain's medieval past. In fact, many of that country's best poets, philosophers, and intellectuals have accepted the <em>corrida</em> as the embodiment of Spain's rejection of the modern world. In his brilliant new interpretation of bullfighting, Adrian Shubert maintains that this view is both the product of myth and a complete misunderstanding of the real roots of the contemporary bullfight.<br /> While references to a form of bullfighting date back to the Poem of the Cid (1040), the modern bullfight did not emerge until the early 18th century. And when it did emerge, it was far from being an archaic remnant of the past--it was a precursor of the 20th-century mass leisure industry. Indeed, before today's multimillion-dollar athletes with wide-spread commercial appeal, there was Francisco Romero, born in 1700, whose unique form of bullfighting netted him unprecedented fame and wealth, and Manuel Rodriguez Manolete, hailed as Spain's greatest matador by the <em>New York Times</em> after a fatal goring in 1947. The bullfight was replete with promoters, agents, journalists, and, of course, hugely-paid bullfighters who were exploited to promote wine, cigarettes, and other products. Shubert analyzes the business of the sport, and explores the bullfighters' world: their social and geographic origins, careers, and social status. Here also are surprising revelations about the sport, such as the presence of women bullfighters--and the larger gender issues that this provoked. From the political use of bullfighting in royal and imperial pageants to the nationalistic ""great patriotic bullfights"" of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this is both a fascinating portrait of bullfighting and a vivid recreation of two centuries of Spanish history.<br /> Based on extensive research and engagingly written, <em>Death and Money in the Afternoon</em> vividly examines the evolution of Spanish culture and society through the prism of one of the West's first--and perhaps its most spectacular--spectator sports.<br />"

"From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism",,Fred Turner,eng,9001,1st edition,University of Chicago Press,327,,,,"In the early 1960s, computers haunted the American popular imagination. Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place. <br /><br /><em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</em> is the first book to explore this extraordinary and ironic transformation. Fred Turner here traces the previously untold story of a highly influential group of San Francisco Bay–area entrepreneurs: Stewart Brand and the <em>Whole Earth</em> network. Between 1968 and 1998, via such familiar venues as the National Book Award–winning <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, the computer conferencing system known as WELL, and, ultimately, the launch of the wildly successful <em>Wired</em> magazine, Brand and his colleagues brokered a long-running collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley. Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers. <br /><br />Shedding new light on how our networked culture came to be, this fascinating book reminds us that the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google, between Ken Kesey and the computer itself, is not as great as we might think."

A lifelong opera lover, his articles and essays, talks for the BBC, contributions to the <i>Grove Dictionary of Opera</i>, and program notes for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and the English National Opera, generated a devoted following. <br /><br />This elegant volume brings together these widely scattered and largely unobtainable pieces, including two that have not been previously published. It covers an engaging range of topics from Mozart to Wagner, including sparkling essays on specific operas by those composers as well as Verdi, Puccini, Strauss, Debussy, Janacek, and Tippett. Reflecting Williams’s brilliance, passion, and clarity of mind, these essays engage with, and illustrate, the enduring appeal of opera as an art form."
Problems of the Self: Philosophical Papers 1956-1972,,Bernard Williams,eng,9004,,Cambridge University Press,276,,,,"This is a volume of philosophical studies, centred on problems of personal identity and extending to related topics in the philosophy of mind and moral philosophy."
Shame and Necessity,,Bernard Williams,,9005,,University of California Press,254,,,,"We tend to suppose that the ancient Greeks had primitive ideas of the self, of responsibility, freedom, and shame, and that now humanity has advanced from these to a more refined moral consciousness. Bernard Williams's original and radical book questions this picture of Western history. While we are in many ways different from the Greeks, Williams claims that the differences are not to be traced to a shift in these basic conceptions of ethical life. We are more like the ancients than we are prepared to acknowledge, and only when this is understood can we properly grasp our most important differences from them, such as our rejection of slavery.<br /><br />The author is a philosopher, but much of his book is directed to writers such as Homer and the tragedians, whom he discusses as poets and not just as materials for philosophy. At the center of his study is the question of how we can understand Greek tragedy at all, when its world is so far from ours.<br /><br />Williams explains how it is that when the ancients speak, they do not merely tell us about themselves, but about ourselves. <i>Shame and Necessity</i> gives a new account of our relations to the Greeks, and helps us to see what ethical ideas we need in order to live in the modern world."
Philosophy as a Humanistic Discipline,"[{'id': '3804', 'name': 'Bernard Williams', 'role': ''}, {'id': '435531', 'name': 'A.W. Moore', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Bernard Williams,,9006,,Princeton University Press,264,,,,"What can--and what can't--philosophy do? What are its ethical risks--and its possible rewards? How does it differ from science? In <i>Philosophy as a Humanistic Discipline</i>, Bernard Williams addresses these questions and presents a striking vision of philosophy as fundamentally different from science in its aims and methods even though there is still in philosophy something that counts as getting it right. Written with his distinctive combination of rigor, imagination, depth, and humanism, the book amply demonstrates why Williams was one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century.<br /><br /><br /> Spanning his career from his first publication to one of his last lectures, the book's previously unpublished or uncollected essays address metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, as well as the scope and limits of philosophy itself. The essays are unified by Williams's constant concern that philosophy maintain contact with the human problems that animate it in the first place. As the book's editor, A. W. Moore, writes in his introduction, the title essay is a kind of manifesto for Williams's conception of his own life's work. It is where he most directly asks what philosophy can and cannot contribute to the project of making sense of things--answering that what philosophy can best help make sense of is being human.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Philosophy as a Humanistic Discipline</i> is one of three posthumous books by Williams to be published by Princeton University Press. <i>In the Beginning Was the Deed: Realism and Moralism in Political Argument</i> was published in the fall of 2005. <i>The Sense of the Past: Essays in the History of Philosophy</i> is being published shortly after the present volume.<br /><br />-- ""Choice"""
Moral Luck: Philosophical Papers 1973-1980,,Bernard Williams,eng,9007,,Cambridge University Press,188,,,,"A new volume of philosophical essays by Bernard Williams. The book is a successor to Problems of the Self, but whereas that volume dealt mainly with questions of personal identity, Moral Luck centres on questions of moral philosophy and the theory of rational action. That whole area has of course been strikingly reinvigorated over the last deacde, and philosophers have both broadened and deepened their concerns in a way that now makes much earlier moral and political philosophy look sterile and trivial. Moral Luck contains a number of essays that have contributed influentially to this development. Among the recurring themes are the moral and philosophical limitations of utilitarianism, the notion of integrity, relativism, and problems of moral conflict and rational choice. The work presented here is marked by a high degree of imagination and acuity, and also conveys a strong sense of psychological reality. The volume will be a stimulating source of ideas and arguments for all philosophers and a wide range of other readers."
Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy,,Bernard Williams,en-US,9008,,Harvard University Press,230,,,,"Bernard Williams is an eloquent member of that small but important group of distinguished thinkers who are trying to erase the borders between the experts and all of us who grapple with moral issues in our own lives. In this book he delivers a sustained indictment of systematic moral theory from Kant onward and offers a persuasive alternative.<br /><br />Kant's ideas involved a view of the self we can no longer accept. Modern theories such as utilitarianism and contractualism usually offer criteria that lie outside the self altogether, and this, together with an emphasis on system, has weakened ethical thought. Why should a set of ideas have any special authority over our sentiments just because it has the structure of a theory? How could abstract theory help the individual answer the Socratic question ""How should I live?""<br /><br />Williams's goal is nothing less than to reorient ethics toward the individual. He accuses modern moral philosophers of retreating to system and deserting individuals in their current social context. He believes that the ethical work of Plato and Aristotle is nearer to the truth of what ethical life is, but at the same time recognizes that the modern world makes unparalleled demands on ethical thought. He deals with the most thorny questions in contemporary philosophy and offers new ideas about issues such as relativism, objectivity, and the possibility of ethical knowledge. Williams has written an imaginative, ingenious book that calls for philosophers to transcend their self-imposed limits and to give full attention to the complexities of the ethical life."
Making Sense of Humanity: And Other Philosophical Papers 1982-1993,,Bernard Williams,,819417,,Cambridge University Press,264,,,,"Like the two earlier volumes of Bernard Williams' papers published by Cambridge University Press, Problems of the Self and Moral Luck, Making Sense of Humanity will be welcomed by all readers with a serious interest in philosophy. It is published alongside a volume of essays on Williams' work, World, Mind and Ethics: Essays on the Ethical Philosophy of Bernard Williams, edited by J.E.J. Altham and Ross Harrison, which provides a reappraisal of his work by other distinguished thinkers in the field."
Truth and Truthfulness: An Essay in Genealogy,,Bernard Williams,,1839700,,Princeton University Press,344,,,,"What does it mean to be truthful? What role does truth play in our lives? What do we lose if we reject truthfulness? No philosopher is better suited to answer these questions than Bernard Williams. Writing with his characteristic combination of passion and elegant simplicity, he explores the value of truth and finds it to be both less and more than we might imagine.<br /><br /><br /> Modern culture exhibits two attitudes toward truth: suspicion of being deceived (no one wants to be fooled) and skepticism that objective truth exists at all (no one wants to be naive). This tension between a demand for truthfulness and the doubt that there is any truth to be found is not an abstract paradox. It has political consequences and signals a danger that our intellectual activities, particularly in the humanities, may tear themselves to pieces.<br /><br /><br /> Williams's approach, in the tradition of Nietzsche's genealogy, blends philosophy, history, and a fictional account of how the human concern with truth might have arisen. Without denying that we should worry about the contingency of much that we take for granted, he defends truth as an intellectual objective and a cultural value. He identifies two basic virtues of truth, Accuracy and Sincerity, the first of which aims at finding out the truth and the second at telling it. He describes different psychological and social forms that these virtues have taken and asks what ideas can make best sense of them today.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> presents a powerful challenge to the fashionable belief that truth has no value, but equally to the traditional faith that its value guarantees itself. Bernard Williams shows us that when we lose a sense of the value of truth, we lose a lot both politically and personally, and may well lose everything."
Descartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry,,Bernard Williams,,805151,,Routledge,308,,,,"Descartes has often been called the 'father of modern philosophy'.His attempts to find foundations for knowledge, and to reconcile the existence of the soul with the emerging science of his time, are among the most influential and widely studied in the history of philosophy.<br /><br />This is a classic and challenging introduction to Descartes by one of the most distinguished modern philosophers. Bernard Williams not only analyzes Descartes' project of founding knowledge on certainty, but uncovers the philosophical motives for his search. With acute insight, he demonstrates how Descartes' <em>Meditations </em>are not merely a description but the very enactment of philosophical thought and discovery. Williams covers all of the key areas of Descartes' thought, including God, the will, the possibility of knowledge, and the mind and its place in nature. He also makes profound contributions to the theory of knowledge, metaphysics and philosophy generally. This is essential reading for any student of philosophy.<br /><br />This reissue includes a new foreword by John Cottingham."

Davidson, who places the novel in an historical and literary perspective. Ranging from serious cautionary tales about moral corruption to amusing and trenchant social satire, these books provide today's reader with a unique window into the earliest American popular fiction and way of life.<br /><br />First published in 1801, Female Quixotism is a boisterous, rollicking anti-romance and literary satire. It takes place in the fictional village of L---, Pennsylvania, where its central character Dorcas Sheldon—who styles herself the romantic ""Dorcasina""—sets out on a quixotic quest for the kind of romantic love portrayed in her favorite English novels. Having rejected the prosaic yet honorable advances of her first suitor, ""Lysander,"" Dorcasina narrowly escapes marriage to a series of unscrupulous rogues interested mostly in her considerable fortune. Moving from one misadventure to another, the heroine's journey ends in a lonely old age bereft of romantic illusion.<br /><br />Female Quixotism was written during a period of self-definition for the fledgling American republic, and offers a telling glimpse of gender, race, and class issues—as volatile then as they are today. Its woman's-eye view of the life and literature of the age provides a tragicomic parody of the limited choices available to women in a society dedicated to the principle that all <i>men</i> are created equal.<br />"

On Rhetoric and Language: Four Key Dialogues,,Jean Nienkamp,eng,9015,,Routledge,232,,,,"<p><i>Plato on Rhetoric and Language</i> presents, for the first time in one volume, four key Platonic dialogues on rhetoric and language in complete, contemporary translations: the <i>Ion,</i> the <i>Protagoras,</i> the <i>Gorgias,</i> and the <i>Phaedrus.</i> Previously, those interested in reading or teaching these dialogues had to acquire several books, typically having introductions that portrayed Plato's philosophy as strictly anti-rhetorical. The introduction to this volume treats Plato's discussions of the language arts as central to his philosophical practice. Reflecting current critical discussions about the significance of ambiguities and inconsistencies in the dialogues, the introduction approaches them as enacting the dialogical and rhetorical practice of philosophy rather than as expositions of doctrine. Readers are thus invited to participate in the dialogues as vital philosophical conversations about issues that animate contemporary rhetorical and literary thought today.</p><p>Specific features of this text include:</p><p>• four key dialogues on rhetoric and language presented in one volume in complete, contemporary translations;</p><p>• an introduction that discusses the complexities of Plato's dialogues and views on language, writing, dialogue, rhetoric, and poetics in a readable style;</p><p>• brief introductions to each dialogue that point out the major features of the dialogue as well as raise questions to stimulate thoughtful reading;</p><p>• an expanded bibliography for those interested in pursuing further critical discussion of the texts; and</p><p>• an index to key terms and concepts covered in the introduction and dialogues.</p>"
Brazilian Immigrants in the United States: Cultural Imperialism and Social Class,,Bernadete Beserra,,9016,,LFB Scholarly Publishing,260,,,,"Beserra examines Brazilian immigration to the United States from the perspective of the relationship between the two countries as it developed through American imperialist expansion in Brazil. Drawing on ethnographic research among Brazilians in Los Angeles, she shows that direct or indirect contact with American culture develops the need to live or the dream of living in the United States. Once in the U.S., different expectations and reasons for immigrating, class position in Brazil, and the networks to which Brazilian immigrants are connected define how they will integrate into American society. By exploring the experiences of the members of two Brazilian associations, the Portuguese-speaking Seventh-Day Adventist Church of Chino, and the Brazilian Women's Group in Los Angeles, Beserra offers important clues for understanding the various expressions of the political economy of social class, race, and ethnicity in the United States."

"Living Without Philosophy: On Narrative, Rhetoric, and Morality",,Peter Levine,,498724,,State University of New York Press,352,,,,"Living Without Philosophy argues that we do not need ethical theories, rules, and principles to decide what is right. Instead, particular cases can be judged by a detailed description of the relevant circumstances. When our judgments differ, we can decide how to act by deliberating under fair conditions. The author provides both a philosophical argument for this position and readings of literary texts in which moral theorists are portrayed as concrete characters. These works include Plato's Protagoras, selections from the Gospels and Dante, Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, the debate between Erasmus and Luther, Erasmus's Praise of Folly, Shakespeare's King Lear, Nabokov's Lolita, and Martin Luther King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail. Thus, Levine offers essentially a moral argument for the humanities, discussing the implications not only for ethics, but also for theology, law, politics, and education."

Barbarians in the Saddle: Intellectual Biography of Richard M. Weaver,,Joseph Scotchie,,9076,,Routledge,161,,,,"Richard M. Weaver was one of the founders of modern conservatism and an enduring intellectual figure of twentieth-century America. He was dedicated to examining the dual nature of human beings and the quest for civilized communities in a corrupted age that believed in the religion of science and in the ""natural goodness"" of man. Weaver's <em>Ideas Have Consequences </em>sowed the seeds for the traditionalist wing of modern American conservatism. On the brink of the twenty-first century, the triumph of science and technology looms larger than ever. Weaver's prophetic writings on post-World War II Western decline and his visionary talents, however bleak, can easily extend into many facets of modern life: high divorce rates, a declining standard of living, the dehumanizing aspects of a corporate economy, and the destruction of civil communities.<br /><br /><em>Barbarians in the Saddle </em>is Joseph Scotchie's intellectual biography of Richard M. Weaver. It is an in-depth study of each of Weaver's published works and an examination of the significant influence he had on the formation of conservative America. <em>Ideas Have Consequences </em>and <em>Visions of Order </em>examine the problem of life in ""megalopolis"" where the best of everything is promised to the restless masses by their leaders and a cradle-to-grave social security state results in dangerous levels of decadence, resentment, and the loss of civility and culture. In <em>The Southern Tradition at Bay </em>and other essays on the American South, Weaver expresses his preference for the nonmaterialistic, virtuous ethos of the Old South. Finally, <em>The Ethics of Rhetoric </em>highlights Weaver's devotion to a discipline increasingly out of favor with academia.<br /><br />Thirty years after his untimely death, Richard Weaver remains a heroic figure to many concerned about the state of American culture and its alienated, rootless conditions. Now a new generation of leaders can understand the importance of this pioneer of thought. <em>Barbarians in the Saddle </em>will be of significant value to political theorists, philosophers, and students of American civilization."

Miller focuses on rhetoric (persuasive discourse) as a central aspect of everyday work and as a means of analyzing activities and relationships. He shows, for example, how staff members, clients, and supervisors rhetorically define and justify organizational purposes, or typical and preferred organizational solutions to problems.

Phelan's compelling readings cover important theoretical ground by introducing a valuable distinction between disclosure functions (communications from the implied author to the authorial audience) and narrator functions (communications from the character narrator to the narratee). Phelan also identifies significant types of character narration (also known as first-person narration), including restricted, suppressed, and mask narrations. In addition, Phelan proposes new understandings of such ingrained concepts of narrative theory as unreliable narration, the implied author, focalization, and lyric narrative.<br /><br />Utilizing what Phelan and Peter J. Rabinowitz have called theory practice, a critical method that aims to combine theory and interpretation in mutually illuminating ways, Living to Tell about It also makes a major contribution to ethical theory and criticism. Phelan develops the concept of ethical position and explores the interactions among the ethical positions of characters, narrators, authors, and audiences. This approach emphasizes not only the close connections between narrative technique and ethics but also the important interactions between the ethical positions of the authorial audience and the flesh-and-blood reader."

Jeffries, though, was trounced. Whites everywhere rioted. The furor, Gail Bederman demonstrates, was part of two fundamental and volatile national obsessions: manhood and racial dominance. <br /><br />In turn-of-the-century America, cultural ideals of manhood changed profoundly, as Victorian notions of self-restrained, moral manliness were challenged by ideals of an aggressive, overtly sexualized masculinity. Bederman traces this shift in values and shows how it brought together two seemingly contradictory ideals: the unfettered virility of racially ""primitive"" men and the refined superiority of ""civilized"" white men. Focusing on the lives and works of four very different Americans—Theodore Roosevelt, educator G. Stanley Hall, Ida B. Wells, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman—she illuminates the ideological, cultural, and social interests these ideals came to serve."

"Manliness and Its Discontents: The Black Middle Class and the Transformation of Masculinity, 1900-1930",,Martin Summers,,9090,,University of North Carolina Press,400,,,,"In a pathbreaking new assessment of the shaping of black male identity in the early twentieth century, Martin Summers explores how middle-class African American and African Caribbean immigrant men constructed a gendered sense of self through organizational life, work, leisure, and cultural production. Examining both the public and private aspects of gender formation, Summers challenges the current trajectory of masculinity studies by treating black men as historical agents in their own identity formation, rather than as screens on which white men projected their own racial and gender anxieties and desires.<br /><i>Manliness and Its Discontents</i> focuses on four distinct yet overlapping social milieus: the fraternal order of Prince Hall Freemasonry; the black nationalist Universal Negro Improvement Association, or the Garvey movement; the modernist circles of the Harlem Renaissance; and the campuses of historically black Howard and Fisk Universities. Between 1900 and 1930, Summers argues, dominant notions of what it meant to be a man within the black middle class changed from a Victorian ideal of manliness--characterized by the importance of producer values, respectability, and patriarchy--to a modern ethos of masculinity, which was shaped more by consumption, physicality, and sexuality. Summers evaluates the relationships between black men and black women as well as relationships among black men themselves, broadening our understanding of the way that gender works along with class, sexuality, and age to shape identities and produce relationships of power."

"Manliness and Masculinities in Nineteenth-Century Britain: Essays on Gender, Family and Empire",,John Tosh,,9092,,Routledge,232,,,,"In the space of barely fifteen years, the history of masculinity has become an important dimension of social and cultural history. John Tosh has been in the forefront of the field since the beginning, having written <i>A Man's Place: Masculinity and the Middle-Class Home in Victorian England </i>(1999), and co-edited <i>Manful Assertions: Masculinities in </i><i>Britain</i><i>since 1800 </i>(1991). Here he brings together nine key articles which he has written over the past ten years. These pieces document the aspirations of the first contributors to the field, and the development of an agenda of key historical issues which have become central to our conceptualising of gender in history. Later essays take up the issue of periodisation and the relationship of masculinity to other historical identities and structures, particularly in the context of the family. The last two essays, published for the first time, approach British imperial history in a fresh way. They argue that the empire needs to be seen as a specifically male enterprise, answering to masculine aspirations and insecurities. This leads to illuminating insights into the nature of colonial emigration and the popular investment in empire during the era the New Imperialism."

Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust, and sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice.

Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this ""Anna Karenina"" will be the definitive text for generations to come. <br /> ""Pevear and Volokhonsky are at once scrupulous translators and vivid stylists of English, and their superb rendering allows us, as perhaps never before, to grasp the palpability of Tolstoy's 'characters, acts, situations.'""

The centerpiece of this collection, the short novel <i>The Eternal Husband,</i> describes the almost surreal meeting of a cuckolded widower and his dead wife’s lover. Dostoevsky’s dark brilliance and satiric vision infuse the other four tales with all-too-human characters, including a government official who shows up uninvited at an underling’s wedding to prove his humanity; a self-deceiving narrator who struggles futilely to understand his wife’s suicide; and a hack writer who attends a funeral and ends up talking with the dead.<br /><br /><b>The Eternal Husband and Other Stories</b> is sterling Dostoevsky—a collection of emotional power and uncompromising insight into the human condition."

Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.<br /><br />Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch.

The best known of Dostoevsky’s masterpieces, Crime and Punishment can bear any amount of rereading without losing a drop of its power over our imaginations.

The Master and Margarita,"[{'id': '3873', 'name': 'Mikhail Bulgakov', 'role': ''}, {'id': '3357', 'name': 'Richard Pevear', 'role': 'Translator'}, {'id': '3358', 'name': 'Larissa Volokhonsky', 'role': 'Translator'}]",Mikhail Bulgakov,eng,876183,,Penguin Classics,448,,,,"Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0141180145 (ISBN13: 9780141180144)<br /><br />Surely, no stranger work exists in the annals of protest literature than <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Written during the Soviet crackdown of the 1930s, when Mikhail Bulgakov's works were effectively banned, it wraps its anti-Stalinist message in a complex allegory of good and evil. Or would that be the other way around? The book's chief character is Satan, who appears in the guise of a foreigner and self-proclaimed black magician named Woland. Accompanied by a talking black tomcat and a ""translator"" wearing a jockey's cap and cracked pince-nez, Woland wreaks havoc throughout literary Moscow. First, he predicts that the head of noted editor Berlioz will be cut off; when it is, he appropriates Berlioz's apartment. (A puzzled relative receives the following telegram: ""Have just been run over by streetcar at Patriarch's Ponds funeral Friday three afternoon come Berlioz."") Woland and his minions transport one bureaucrat to Yalta, make another one disappear entirely except for his suit, and frighten several others so badly that they end up in a psychiatric hospital. In fact, it seems half of Moscow shows up in the bin, demanding to be placed in a locked cell for protection. <p> Meanwhile, a few doors down in the hospital lives the true object of Woland's visit: the author of an unpublished novel about Pontius Pilate. This Master — as he calls himself — has been driven mad by rejection, broken not only by editors' harsh criticism of his novel but, Bulgakov suggests, by political persecution as well. Yet Pilate's story becomes a kind of parallel narrative, appearing in different forms throughout Bulgakov's novel: as a manuscript read by the Master's indefatigable love, Margarita, as a scene dreamed by the poet — and fellow lunatic — Ivan Homeless, and even as a story told by Woland himself. Since we see this narrative from so many different points of view, who is truly its author? Given that the Master's novel and this one end the same way, are they in fact the same book? These are only a few of the many questions Bulgakov provokes, in a novel that reads like a set of infinitely nested Russian dolls: inside one narrative there is another, and then another, and yet another. His devil is not only entertaining, he is <i>necessary</i>: ""What would your good be doing if there were no evil, and what would the earth look like if shadows disappeared from it?""</p><p> Unsurprisingly — in view of its frequent, scarcely disguised references to interrogation and terror — Bulgakov's master work was not published until 1967, almost three decades after his death. Yet one wonders if the world was really ready for this book in the late 1930s, if, indeed, we are ready for it now. Shocking, touching, and scathingly funny, it is a novel like no other. Woland may re-attach heads or produce 10-ruble notes from the air, but Bulgakov proves to be the true magician here. <i>The Master and Margarita</i> is a different book each time it is opened. <i>— Mary Park</i></p>"

The myths surrounding Basque matriarchy and the extent of women's rule fixed in a mythical past are questioned. While the powerful mother figure has a vital role in handing down Basque language and culture, contemporary women are also breaking old stereotypes and carving out new niches for themselves, at times coming into conflict with the force of tradition.

We meet merchants selling yarns and dyes, silk and rugs, jade (""fished"" from the rivers) and gold, daggers and shish-kebab, melons and pilaf. And we get a sense of the colorful people who visit the bazaar, the Uygar men with shaved heads and the women in bright silk dresses, billiard players in the open air, young boys watching an old man make paper beneath a trellis of grape vines. And along the way, Yung provides an illuminating commentary on the region's history, describes the legendary trading cities of Kashi, Shache, and Hotan, and discusses current efforts to maintain the Islamic heritage and identity of Xinjiang.<br /> Bazaars of Chinese Turkestan takes us to a world few of us knew existed.

This authoritative and profusely illustrated compendium celebrates the achievements of those ancient builders who created huge and impressive structures without the benefit of modern technology. Expanding upon the theme of the traditional Seven Wonders, The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World incorporates marvels from around the globe, spanning the centuries from the first stone monuments of the fifth millennium b.c. to the Great Temple of the Aztecs in the sixteenth century a.d. The shaping of the Great Sphinx at Giza, the raising of the stones at Stonehenge, the laying out of the Nazca Lines on the face of the Peruvian desert, or the construction of the Great Wall of China (probably the greatest building project ever attempted in ancient times) are all described and explained in light of the most up-to-date archaeological research. So too are the erection of Egyptian obelisks and Easter Island statues, and the building of Roman roads and Inca bridges. Neglected monuments such as the giant stelae of Aksum or the mountain palace at Sigiriya are set beside the great Baths of Caracalla in Rome and the palace of Persepolis. Packed with factfiles, diagrams, photographs, and newly commissioned perspective views, The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World provides a testament to the skill of the ancient engineers and architects who created lasting memorials--some for practical ends, others for prestige and propaganda--that have continued to impress successive generations through the ages."

This time Bryant and May are up against a series of bizarre murders that defy human understanding — and a killer no human hand may be able to stop.<br /><br />A mysterious stranger in outlandish Edwardian garb defaces a painting in the National Gallery. Then a guest at the exclusive Savoy Hotel is fatally bitten by what appears to be a marshland snake. An outbreak of increasingly bizarre crimes has hit London — and, fittingly, come to the attention of the Peculiar Crimes Unit.<br /><br />Art vandalism, an exploding suspect, pornography, rat poison, Gilbert and Sullivan musicals, secret societies...and not a single suspect in sight.

These concerns, often ignored in earlier studies that focused on social and economic aspects of Asian American communities, challenge some long-held assumptions about Asian American communities and point to new directions in Asian American historiography.

Their struggle becomes primarily economic as they continue to negotiate new cultures and deal with rapidly changing gender and intergenerational relations within their own families. Poverty, crime, and racial discrimination all have an impact on their experiences in America, and each is examined in depth.  <br />  <br /> Although written as a history, this is a thoroughly multidisciplinary study, and Chan makes use of research from anthropology, sociology, psychology, medicine, social work, linguistics and education. She also captures the perspective of individual Cambodians. Drawing on interviews with more than fifty community leaders, a hundred government officials, and staff members in volunteer agencies, <i>Survivors</i> synthesizes the literature on Cambodian refugees, many of whom come from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.<br />  <br /> A major scholarly achievement, <i>Survivors</i> is unique in the Asian American canon for its memorable presentation of cutting-edge research and its interpretation of both sides of the immigration process.<br />"
The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature,,Steven Pinker,eng,9151,,Penguin Books,528,,,,"In <i>The Blank Slate</i>, Steven Pinker explores the idea of human nature and its moral, emotional, and political colorings. He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas: <b>the Blank Slate</b> (the mind has no innate traits), <b>the Noble Savage</b> (people are born good and corrupted by society), and <b>the Ghost in the Machine</b> (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.<br /><br />Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality, progress, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking, common sense, and pertinent facts from science and history.<br /><br />Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century, he argues, the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of government, violence, parenting, and the arts.<br /><br />Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense, far from being dangerous, can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers. All this is done in the style that earned his previous books many prizes and worldwide acclaim: <b>wit, lucidity, and insight into matters great and small</b>."
Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language,,Steven Pinker,eng,9152,,,397,256688,The Science Masters Series,,"In <em>Words and Rules</em>, Steven Pinker explains the mysteries of language by examining a single construction from a dozen viewpoints, proposing that the essence of language is a mental dictionary of memorized words, and a mental grammar of creative rules."
How the Mind Works,,Steven Pinker,eng,2085667,,Penguin Books,660,,,,"In this follow-up to The Language Instinct, the author extends the Darwinian cognitive approach of his previous book to the mind in general, covering its aspects from vision, memory and consciousness to humour, fear, lust and anger.

With deft use of examples of humor and wordplay, Steven Pinker weaves our vast knowledge of language into a compelling story: language is a human instinct, wired into our brains by evolution. <em>The Language Instinct</em> received the William James Book Prize from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistics Society of America.

Mehler', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Steven Pinker,eng,9155,,Bradford Book,432,70964,"Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change",,"When children learn a language, they soon are able to make surprisingly subtle distinctions: ""donate them a book"" sounds odd, for example, even though ""give them a book"" is perfectly natural. How can this happen, given that children do not confine themselves to the sentence types they hear, and are usually not corrected when they speak ungrammatically? Steven Pinker resolves this paradox in a detailed theory of how children acquire argument structure.<br /><br />In tackling a learning paradox that has challenged scholars for more than a decade, Pinker synthesizes a vast literature in linguistics and psycholinguistics and outlines explicit theories of the mental representation, learning, and development of verb meaning and verb syntax. The new theory that he describes has some surprising implications for the relation between language and thought.Pinker's solution provides insight into such key questions as, When do children generalize and when do they stick with what they hear? What is the rationale behind linguistic constraints? How is the syntax of predicates and arguments related to their semantics? What is a possible word meaning? Do languages force their speakers to construe the world in certain ways? Why does children's language seem different from that of adults?<br /><br /><i>Learnability and Cognition is included in the series Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change, edited by Lila Gleitman, Susan Carey, Elissa Newport, and Elizabeth Spelke.</i><br /><br /><i>A Bradford Book</i>"
How the Mind Works,,Steven Pinker,,2085667,,Scientific American Modern Classics,660,,,,"In this extraordinary bestseller, Steven Pinker, one of the world's leading cognitive scientists, does for the rest of the mind what he did for language in his 1994 book, <em>The Language Instinct</em>. He explains what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and ponder the mysteries of life. And he does it with the wit that prompted Mark Ridley to write in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, ""No other science writer makes me laugh so much. . . . [Pinker] deserves the superlatives that are lavished on him.""  The arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection, and challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

But, over the past decade, House leaders fearful of losing power have torn the House from its roots.

George W. Bush et. al., former federal prosecutor Elizabeth de la Vega brings her twenty years of experience and her passion for justice to the most important case of her career. The defendants are George W Bush, Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, and Colin Powell. The crime is tricking the nation into war, or, in legal terms, conspiracy to defraud the United States.<br />Ms. de la Vega has reviewed the evidence, researched the law, drafted an indictment, and in this lively, accessible book, presented it to a grand jury. If the indictment and grand jury are both hypothetical, the facts are tragically real: Over half of all Americans believe the president misled the country into a war that has left 2,500 hundred American soldiers and countless Iraqis dead. The cost is $350 billion -- and counting.<br />The legal question is: Did the president and his team use the same techniques as those used by Enron's Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and fraudsters everywhere -- false pretenses, half-truths, deliberate omissions -- in order to deceive Congress and the American public?<br />Take advantage of this rare opportunity to ""sit"" with the grand jurors as de la Vega presents a case of prewar fraud that should persuade any fair-minded person who loves this country as much as she so obviously does. Faced with an ongoing crime of such magnitude, she argues, we can not simply shrug our shoulders and walk away."

Lines of Flight: Discursive Time and Countercultural Desire in the Work of Thomas Pynchon,"[{'id': '3969', 'name': 'Stefan Mattessich', 'role': ''}, {'id': '269530', 'name': 'Stanley Fish', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Stefan Mattessich,,9204,,Duke University Press Books,304,,,,"For Thomas Pynchon, the characteristic features of late capitalism—the rise of the military-industrial complex, consumerism, bureaucratization and specialization in the workplace, standardization at all levels of social life, and the growing influence of the mass media—all point to a transformation in the way human beings experience time and duration. Focusing on Pynchon’s novels as representative artifacts of the postwar period, Stefan Mattessich analyzes this temporal transformation in relation not only to Pynchon’s work but also to its literary, cultural, and theoretical contexts.<br />Mattessich theorizes a new kind of time—subjective displacement—dramatized in the parody, satire, and farce deployed through Pynchon’s oeuvre. In particular, he is interested in showing how this sense of time relates to the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. Examining this movement as an instance of flight or escape and exposing the beliefs behind it, Mattessich argues that the counterculture’s rejection of the dominant culture ultimately became an act of self-cancellation, a rebellion in which the counterculture found itself defined by the very order it sought to escape. He points to parallels in Pynchon’s attempts to dramatize and enact a similar experience of time in the doubling-back, crisscrossing, and erasure of his writing. Mattessich lays out a theory of cultural production centered on the ethical necessity of grasping one’s own susceptibility to discursive forms of determination."

Herself the pupil of the great Manuel Garcia the Second and the associate of the unsurpassable divas of the middle nineteenth century, she also linked the traditional bel canto teaching method to the beginning of the twentieth century. Early in her career her work was praised enthusiastically by Rossini, who was for a time officially in charge of voice training in France; and toward the end of her career she prepared such superstars as Melba, Calvé, Eames, Aida, and others.<br />This volume embodies Madame Marchesi's ""vocal alphabet,"" or basic instructions and exercises that formed the voices of her great pupils. An introductory text discusses breathing, attack, registers, and similar matters, while the remainder of the book contains many exercises that teach voice management and projections.<br />Marchesi's book is today even more important than when it first appeared, for it offers the basis for a construction of the bel canto training system. At the time the book appeared, the bel canto system had gone out of fashion in favor of more modern schools that seemed to offer more rapid maturation, voice volume, and dramatics. Today, a more realistic reevaluation has revealed that the bel canto system gave the singer much longer performing life, a more pleasing voice, and far greater musical ability. As Philip Miller states in his introduction, ""a solidity, a sure technical mastery, an even scale with no register break . . . strong, even and secure trills, their coloratura masterly."" In addition, the resurgence of interest in early-nineteenth-century opera renders a work like Marchesi's indispensable to the modern singer.<br />"

He also presents data from a series of laboratory experiments carried out to demonstrate the techniques of <i>bel canto</i>.<br /><br />The discussion deals extensively with such topics as the emergence of virtuoso singing, the castrato phenomenon, national differences in singing styles, controversies regarding the perennial decline in the art of singing, and the so-called secrets of <i>bel canto</i>.<br /><br />Stark offers a new definition of bel canto which reconciles historical and scientific descriptions of good singing.

North of South: An African Journey,,Shiva Naipaul,eng,525465,,Penguin Classics,352,,,,"In the 1970s Shiva Naipaul travelled to Africa, visiting Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia for several months. Through his experiences, the places he visited and his various encounters, he aimed to discover what 'liberation', 'revolution' and 'socialism' meant to the ordinary people. His journey of discovery is brilliantly documented in this intimate, comic and controversial portrayal of a continent on the brink of change."
Journey to Nowhere: A New World Tragedy,,Shiva Naipaul,,9240,,Penguin Books,336,,,,"Rarely does a book come along which so transcends its apparent subject that the reader is ultimately given something larger, richer, and more revealing than he might initially have imagined. Already published in England to overwhelming acclaim, Shiva Naipaul's <i>Journey to Nowhere</i> is such a book – a “powerful, lucid, and beautifully written book” (<i>The Spectator</i>) that is destined to be one of the most controversial works of 1981.<br /><br />In it, this major writer takes us beyond the events and surface details surrounding the tragedy of Jonestown and the People's Temple – and gives us his remarkable, unique perspective on the deadly drama of ideas, environments, and unholy alliances that shaped those events both in Guyana and, even more significantly, in America.<br /><br /><i>Journey to Nowhere</i> is, on one level, a “brilliantly edgy safari” (<i>New Statesman</i>) <i>inside</i> the Third World itself – a place of increasing importance in our lives – and on another, a book about America, about the corrupt and corrupting ideologies and chi-chi politics of the past twenty years that enabled the Reverend Jim Jones and the Temple to flourish and grow powerful in California and Guyana,<br /><br />Drawing on interviews – with former members of the Temple, various officials, and such people as Buckminster Fuller, Huey Newton, Clark Kerr, and others – on documents, and most importantly, on his own strong, clear reactions on what he observed, Naipaul examines the Guyana of Forbes Burnham, the CIA stooge turned Third World socialist leader, whose stated ideals of socialism, racial brotherhood, and cooperative agricultural enterprise coincided so neatly, we learn for the first time, with those of the People's Temple – ideals that led all too easily to violence and death. “In life,” Naipaul writes, “they had been hailed by the Guyanese government as socialist heroes; in death, they had become hopelessly American.”<br /><br />In California, he traces the ideas generated in the 1960s in the white radical and Black Power movements – and the evolution of those ideas in the 1970s into the preoccupation with “self-realization,” ecology, and “life-style.” We learn of the Temple's formation and of its respected place in the San Francisco community; of Jim Jones and his life, from his small-town Indiana background to his coming West; of the Concerned Relatives and their attempts to totally discredit the Temple and extricate their family members from it. But above all, Naipaul relentlessly explores the American society that produced and nurtured Jones and his followers: the politicians and social workers, the Zen Buddhists and the poor – the junk people whom America professes to care about, but prefers to forget.<br /><br />Absolutely convincing, timely in its message, and written with “the sardonic humor which has become his trademark” (<i>The Times</i>), <i>Journey to Nowhere</i> is “a brilliant achievement” (<i>The Sunday Times</i>). It is certain to be talked about – and argued about – for years to come."
"V.S. Naipaul, Man and Writer",,Gillian Dooley,,9241,,University of South Carolina Press,164,,,,"A survey of the life and work of the 2001 Nobel Laureate for Literature, <i>V. S. Naipaul, Man and Writer</i> introduces readers to the writer widely viewed as a curmudgeonly novelist who finds special satisfaction in overturning the vogue presuppositions of his peers. Gillian Dooley takes an expansive look at Naipaul's literary career, from <i>Miguel Street to Magic Seeds.</i> From readings of his fiction, nonfiction, travel books, and volumes of letters, she elucidates the connections between Naipaul's personal experiences as a Hindu Indian from Trinidad living an expatriate life and the precise, euphonious prose with which he is synonymous.<br /><br />Dooley assesses each of Naipaul's major publications in light of his stated intentions and beliefs, and she traces the development of his writing style over a forty-year career. Devoting separate chapters to three of his chief works, <i>A House for Mr. Biswas, In a Free State, </i> and <i>The Enigma of Arrival, </i> she analyzes their critical reception and the primacy of Naipaul's specific narrative style and voice. Dooley emphasizes that it is, above all, Naipaul's refusal to compromise his vision in order to flatter or appease that has made him a controversial writer. At the same time she sees the integrity with which he reports his subjective response to the world as essential to the lasting success of his work."

Graham Greene's the Power and the Glory and Other Works: A Guide to Understanding the Classics,,Gregor Roy,,1036817,,Monarch Press,112,,,,"How does <i>good</i> spoil, and how can <i>bad</i> be redeemed? In his penetrating novel <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, Graham Greene explores corruption and atonement through a priest and the people he encounters. In the 1930's, one Mexican state has outlawed the Church, naming it a source of greed and debauchery. The priests have been rounded up and forced to marry, abandoning their faith, or been put in front of a firing squad--save one, Padre José, the whisky priest. On the run, and in a blur of alcohol and fear, this fugitive meets a dentist, a banana farmer, and a village woman he knew six years earlier. For a while, he is accompanied by a toothless man--whom he refers to as his Judas and does his best to ditch. Always, a patriotic lieutenant is only a few hours behind, determined to liberate his country from the evils of the Church.<p> <br /><br />Greene has drawn Padre José--and all he encounters--vividly and viscerally. He may have said <i>The Power and the Glory</i> was ""written to a thesis,"" but this brilliant theological thriller has far more mysteries--and troubling ideals--than certainties. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>"

The panel's choice was made with one key question in mind: are these images likely to be known in 20 years' time?

She was also a charter member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In this autobiography, originally published in 1940, Terrell describes the important events and people in her life.<br /><br /><br />Terrell began her career as a teacher, first at Wilberforce College and then at a high school in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Robert Heberton Terrell. After marriage, the women’s suffrage movement attracted her interests and before long she became a prominent lecturer at both national and international forums on women’s rights. A gifted speaker, she went on to pursue a career on the lecture circuit for close to thirty years, delivering addresses on the critical social issues of the day, including segregation, lynching, women’s rights, the progress of black women, and various aspects of black history and culture. Her talents and many leadership positions brought her into close contact with influential black and white leaders, including Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Robert Ingersoll, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Jane Addams, and others.<br /><br /><br />With a new introduction by Debra Newman Ham, professor of history at Morgan State University, this new edition of Mary Church Terrell’s autobiography will be of interest to students and scholars of both women’s studies and African American history."
"The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins, Fiction",,Wilkie Collins,,1303710,,Wildside Press,456,,,,"There, in the middle of the broad bright high-road -- there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven -- stood the figure of a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments, her face bent in grave inquiry on mine, her hand pointing to the dark cloud over London, as I faced her. I was far too seriously startled by the suddenness with which this extraordinary apparition stood before me, in the dead of night and in that lonely place, to ask what she wanted. The strange woman spoke first. ""Is that the road to London?"" she said. I looked attentively at her, as she put that singular question to me. It was then nearly one o'clock. All I could discern distinctly by the moonlight was a colorless, youthful face, meager and sharp to look at about the cheeks and chin; large, grave, wistfully attentive eyes; nervous, uncertain lips; and light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow hue. There was nothing wild, nothing immodest in her manner: it was quiet and self-controlled, a little melancholy and a little touched by suspicion; not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at the same time, not the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life."

Full of surprise, intrigue, and suspense, this vastly entertaining novel continues to enthrall readers today.<br /><br />The story begins with an eerie midnight encounter between artist Walter Hartright and a ghostly woman dressed all in white who seems desperate to share a dark secret. The next day Hartright, engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie and her half sister, tells his pupils about the strange events of the previous evening. Determined to learn all they can about the mysterious woman in white, the three soon find themselves drawn into a chilling vortex of crime, poison, kidnapping, and international intrigue.<br /><br />Masterfully constructed, <i>The Woman in White</i> is dominated by two of the finest creations in all Victorian fiction: Marion Halcombe, dark, mannish, yet irresistibly fascinating, and Count Fosco, the sinister and flamboyant 'Napoleon of Crime'."

When Grandmama Fell Off the Boat: The Best of Harry Graham Inventor of Ruthless Rhymes,,Harry Graham,eng,8315252,,,,,,,"'When Grandmama Fell Off The Boat' is an anthology of the hilarious creations of Harry Graham, one of the early 20th century’s wittiest writers of light verse, stage show lyrics and articles. <br /><br />During his lifetime, Harry Graham had an outstanding reputation and was compared to Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll and W. S. Gilbert by The Times. He has also been credited with introducing ‘sick’ verse to America. <br /><br />Although the ever popular 'Ruthless Rhymes' was republished in 1996, 'When Grandmama Fell Off The Boat' remains the only comprehensive selection of Graham’s verse to have appeared since his death. <br /><br />The book is elegantly designed, the text complemented by delightful and amusing period illustrations by Fish, Fougasse, Ridgewell and others. The anthology also boasts an introduction by the late Miles Kington, as well as a foreword by Graham’s daughter and fellow writer, Virginia. <br /><br />Graham’s black humour is underpinned by his ability to relate common episodes with a sardonic twist. A father irritated by his crying infant finds peace and quiet by popping him in the Frigidaire and a man whose wife elopes with the chauffeur despairs of ever starting the car. <br /><br />These darkly comic soupçons of English life are timeless in their appeal."

Denny', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Fatemeh Keshavarz,,9282,,University of South Carolina Press,193,,,,"<i>Recite the Name of the Red Rose</i> introduces Western readers to constructions of the sacred in twentieth-century Iranian poetry. Sifting through the lives and writings of modern and classical poets, Fatemeh Keshavarz provides a systematic examination of the array of religious impulses in recent Persian verse. Viewing poetry as the site of the emergence of the self and the sacred, she confirms that sanctification is not static in its forms but continuously in flux and that the poetic modes used to articulate the sanctified are equally fluid.<br /><br />Keshevarz begins by introducing the core concepts that define and detach religion and secularity in contemporary Iranian society. By thoroughly discussing the nature of classical Persian poetry she makes clear that expressions of the sacred in verse have been open to negotiation and change even in the premodern period. However, in Iran's modern poetic landscape Keshavarz uncovers many new patterns of expressing the sacred. In individual chapters on the writings of Forugh Farrokhzad (1935-1967), Sohrab Sepehri (1928-1981), and Ahmad Shamlu (1925-2000), she discusses the paradigmatic ways prominent poets of the twentieth century have related to the sacred in a nation forging its vision of modernity.<br /><br />While most scholars perceive current Iranian culture to be sharply divided between literalist conservatives and secular progressives, Keshavarz identifies provocative shades of spiritual expression less rigidly defined and hence neglected by the established critical tradition. Bringing such expression to the fore of scholarly attention, her study invites a more nuanced appreciation of the crosscurrents of religion and literature in recent Middle Eastern culture."

How the Reformation Happened,,Hilaire Belloc,,143318,,Kessinger Publishing,292,,,,Two historical problems are of prime importance to our race. To understand them sufficiently is to understand ourselves. To misapprehend them is to misapprehend our own nature: what made our culture and what threatens to destroy it. The first of these problems is the conversion of the Roman Empire to Catholicism. How came the pagan world to be baptized? What made Christendom? The second is the disaster of the 16th century. How came Christendom to suffer shipwreck? What made the Reformation? It is the second question which Belloc approaches in this book.
The Crusades,,Hilaire Belloc,,9288,,TAN Books,256,,,,"Belloc shows that the Crusades were a titanic struggle between Christian civilization and \""the Turk,\"" savage Mongols who had embraced Islam. He explains the practical reasons why the Crusaders initially succeeded and why they ultimately failed then he predicts the re-emergence of Islam, since Christendom failed to destroy it in the 12th century.

It traces the artistic growth of Murch, as well as his friends and contemporaries -- including directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Fred Zinneman and Anthony Minghella -- from the creation of the independent, anti-Hollywood Zoetrope by a handful of brilliant, bearded young men to the recent triumph of <i>Apocalypse Now Redux</i>.<br /><br />Among the films Murch has worked on are <i>American Graffiti</i>, <i>The Conversation</i>, the remake of <i>A Touch of Evil</i>, <i>Julia</i>, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, <i>The Godfather</i> (all three), <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, and <i>The English Patient</i>.<br /><br /><i>""Walter Murch is a true oddity in Hollywood.

He rails against all that conspires to restrain him: the philosophy of ""that pietistic old prater Confucius, "" the elaborate rules governing the composition of verse, the rigid examinations required to obtain an official post, and the greedy emperors whose expansionism leads China into a period of rebellion and catastrophe.<br /><br />A Floating Life is a magnificent portrayal of a critical time in China's history and the life of a literary legend. Nearly thirteen hundred years after the fact, Simon Elegant's scrupulously researched novel captures the essence of the eccentric bard of spontaneous verse -- lover of birds, breast milk, courtesans, tavern songs and wine -- in fullest splendor and bravado."

In addition to making formal innovations in language and structure, he extended the range of acceptable subject matter to include all aspects of public and private experience, thus becoming in the words of translator David Hinton, “the first complete poetic sensibility in Chinese literature.”<br /><br /><br />This edition of <em>The Selected Poems of Tu Fu</em> is the only comprehensive selection of the poet's work currently available in English. While retaining a scholar's devotion to the text, Hinton has attempted “to recreate Tu Fu's poems as new systems of uncertainty."" By reflecting all the ambiguity and density of the originals, he has created compelling English poems that significantly alter our conception of Chinese poetry. Included with the poems are the translator’s introduction and translation principles. as well as a biography of Tu Fu; together these provide a fascinating portrait of a uniquely sensitive spirit during one of the most tumultuous periods in Chinese history."
A Little Primer of Tu Fu,,David Hawkes,,9367,,,,,,,"The deepest and most varied of the Tang dynasty poets, Tu Fu (Du Fu) is, in the words of David Hinton, the “first complete poetic sensibility in Chinese literature.” Tu Fu merged the public and the private, often in the same poem, as his subjects ranged from the horrors of war to the delights of friendship, from closely observed landscapes to remembered dreams, from the evocation of historical moments to a wry lament over his own thinning hair.<br />  <br /> Although Tu Fu has been translated often, and often brilliantly, David Hawkes’s classic study, first published in 1967, is the only book that demonstrates in depth how his poems were written. Hawkes presents thirty-five poems in the original Chinese, with a pinyin<i> </i>transliteration, a character-by-character translation, and a commentary on the subject, the form, the historical background, and the individual lines. There is no other book quite like it for any language: a nuts-and-bolts account of how Chinese poems in general, and specifically the poems of one of the world’s greatest poets, are constructed. It’s an irresistible challenge for readers to invent their own translations."

Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character,,Jonathan Shay,en-US,9416,,Scribner,272,,,,"<br />In this strikingly original and groundbreaking book, Dr. Shay examines the psychological devastation of war by comparing the soldiers of Homer's <i>Iliad</i> with Vietnam veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the <i>Iliad</i> was written twenty-seven centuries ago it has much to teach about combat trauma, as do the more recent, compelling voices and experiences of Vietnam vets.<br />"
The Mourner's Song: War and Remembrance from the Iliad to Vietnam,,James Tatum,,9422,,University of Chicago Press,235,,,,"No matter when or where they are fought, all wars have one thing in common: a relentless progression to monuments and memorials for the dead. Likewise all art made from war begins and ends in mourning and remembrance. In <i>The Mourner's Song</i>, James Tatum offers incisive discussions of physical and literary memorials constructed in the wake of war, from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to the writings of Stephen Crane, Edmund Wilson, Tim O'Brien, and Robert Lowell.<br /><br />Tatum's touchstone throughout is the <i>Iliad</i>, not just one of the earliest war poems, but also one of the most powerful examples of the way poetry can be a tribute to and consolation for what is lost in war. Reading the <i>Iliad</i> alongside later works inspired by war, Tatum reveals how the forms and processes of art convert mourning to memorial. He examines the role of remembrance and the distance from war it requires; the significance of landscape in memorialization; the artifacts of war that fire the imagination; the intimate relationship between war and love and its effects on the ferocity with which soldiers wage battle; and finally, the idea of memorialization itself. Because all survivors suffer the losses of war, Tatum's is a story of both victims and victors, commanders and soldiers, women and men. Photographs of war memorials in Vietnam, France, and the United States beautifully augment his testimonials. <br /><br />Eloquent and deeply moving, <i>The Mourner's Song</i> will speak to anyone interested in the literature of war and the relevance of the classics to our most pressing contemporary needs."
The Work of Mourning,"[{'id': '4132', 'name': 'Jacques Derrida', 'role': ''}, {'id': '3013046', 'name': 'Pascale-Anne Brault', 'role': 'Editor'}, {'id': '941363', 'name': 'Michael Naas', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Jacques Derrida,eng,1125500,,University of Chicago Press,272,,,,"Jacques Derrida is, in the words of the<i> New York Times</i>, ""perhaps the world's most famous philosopher—if not the only famous philosopher."" He often provokes controversy as soon as his name is mentioned. But he also inspires the respect that comes from an illustrious career, and, among many who were his colleagues and peers, he inspired friendship. <i>The Work of Mourning</i> is a collection that honors those friendships in the wake of passing.<br /><br />Gathered here are texts—letters of condolence, memorial essays, eulogies, funeral orations—written after the deaths of well-known figures: Roland Barthes, Paul de Man, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Edmond Jabès, Louis Marin, Sarah Kofman, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-François Lyotard, Max Loreau, Jean-Marie Benoist, Joseph Riddel, and Michel Servière.<br /><br />With his words, Derrida bears witness to the singularity of a friendship and to the absolute uniqueness of each relationship. In each case, he is acutely aware of the questions of tact, taste, and ethical responsibility involved in speaking of the dead—the risks of using the occasion for one's own purposes, political calculation, personal vendetta, and the expiation of guilt. More than a collection of memorial addresses, this volume sheds light not only on Derrida's relation to some of the most prominent French thinkers of the past quarter century but also on some of the most important themes of Derrida's entire oeuvre-mourning, the ""gift of death,"" time, memory, and friendship itself.<br /><br />""In his rapt attention to his subjects' work and their influence upon him, the book also offers a hesitant and tangential retelling of Derrida's own life in French philosophical history. There are illuminating and playful anecdotes—how Lyotard led Derrida to begin using a word-processor; how Paul de Man talked knowledgeably of jazz with Derrida's son. Anyone who still thinks that Derrida is a facetious punster will find such resentful prejudice unable to survive a reading of this beautiful work.""—Steven Poole, <i>Guardian</i><br /><br />""Strikingly <i>simpa</i> meditations on friendship, on shared vocations and avocations and on philosophy and history.""—<i>Publishers Weekly </i>"
Purest of Bastards - Ppr.,,David Farrell Krell,,9424,,Penn State University Press,256,80267,American and European Philosophy Series,,"The ""deconstruction"" that is commonly seen to be the method of Derrida's philosophy has an inescapably negative connotation. To counter this view of Derrida's thought as basically destructive, David Farrell Krell invites readers to understand how it may instead be seen as fundamentally affirmative--just as Nietzsche's philosophy, so allegedly nihilistic, is at heart a call for tragic affirmation, in <em>amor fati</em>.<br /><br />But, while affirmative, Derrida is also engaged in a thinking of mourning, which he views as the promise of memory--a fragile yet vital promise that binds past and future. The book explores what mourning means in Derrida's writing and how the labors of mourning and affirmation are mediated by works of art. Thus the book engages many different areas of Derrida's work, from the classic texts of deconstruction to the more recent meditations on art and mourning.<br /><br />""This chance [affirmation without issue] can come to us only from you, do you hear me? Do you understand me? . . . And me, the purest of bastards, leaving bastards of all kinds just about everywhere."" This passage from Derrida's <em>La Carte postale </em>nicely encapsulates what David Farrell Krell wants to convey about Derrida's thought<em>--</em>its astonishing mix of negativity and affirmation in his labors of mourning."

Writing Grief: Margaret Laurence and the Work of Mourning,"[{'id': '4136', 'name': 'Christian Riegel', 'role': ''}, {'id': '748573', 'name': 'Jim Blanchard', 'role': 'Editor'}]",Christian Riegel,,9427,,University of Manitoba Press,192,,,,"Margaret Laurence's much admired Manawaka fiction—<i>The Stone Angel</i>, <i>A Jest of God</i>, <i>The Fire-Dwellers</i>, <i>A Bird in the House</i>, and <i>The Diviners</i>—has achieved remarkable recognition for its compassionate portrayal of the attempt to find meaning and peace in ordinary life. In<i> Writing Grief</i>, Christian Riegel argues that the protagonists in these books achieve resolution through acts of mourning, placing this fiction within the larger tradition of writing that explores the nuances and strategies of mourning.      Riegel's analysis alludes to sociological and literary antecedants of the study of mourning, including the tradition of elegy, from Derrida and Lacan to Freud, van Gennep, and Milton. The ""work"" of mourning is necessary to move from a state of emotional paralysis to one of acceptance and active engagement. Laurence's characters ""perform the work of mourning...returning over and over again to the key issues relating to loss,"" and, as Riegel's close examination of the texts suggests, are changed thereafter fundamentally and significantly.      As an important study of one aspect of Laurence's oeuvre, <i>Writing Gri</i>ef not only illustrates how Laurence's own preoccupations with mourning are figured, but also how different ways of working through grief result in renewed potential for consolation and connection, and ""a renewed definition of self."""

Beginning with Constantine the Great, who in a.d. 330 made Christianity the religion of his realm and then transferred its capital to the city that would bear his name, Norwich follows the course of eleven centuries of Byzantine statecraft and warfare, politics and theology, manners and art.<br /><br />In the pages of <b>A Short History of Byzantium</b> we encounter mystics and philosophers, eunuchs and barbarians, and rulers of fantastic erudition, piety, and degeneracy.

He already knew how to speak the Om silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while inhaling, to speak it silently out of himself while exhaling, with all the concentration of his soul, the forehead surrounded by the glow of the clear-thinking spirit.

Describing the difficulty and shame of remembering, the limited forms of collaboration between inmates and SS goalers, the exploitation of useless violence and the plight of the intellectual, Levi writes about the issue of power, mercy and guilt, and their effects on the lives of the ordinary people who suffered so incomprehendingly."

J.M. Coetzee and the Ethics of Reading: Literature in the Event,,Derek Attridge,eng,9515,,University of Chicago Press,240,,,,"Nobel Prize-winning novelist J. M. Coetzee is one of the most widely taught contemporary writers, but also one of the most elusive. Many critics who have addressed his work have devoted themselves to rendering it more accessible and acceptable, often playing down the features that discomfort and perplex his readers.<br /><br />Yet it is just these features, Derek Attridge argues, that give Coetzee's work its haunting power and offer its greatest rewards. Attridge does justice to this power and these rewards in a study that serves as an introduction for readers new to Coetzee and a stimulus for thought for those who know his work well. Without overlooking the South African dimension of his fiction, Attridge treats Coetzee as a writer who raises questions of central importance to current debates both within literary studies and more widely in the ethical arena. Implicit throughout the book is Attridge's view that literature, more than philosophy, politics, or even religion, does singular justice to our ethical impulses and acts. Attridge follows Coetzee's lead in exploring a number of issues such as interpretation and literary judgment, responsibility to the other, trust and betrayal, artistic commitment, confession, and the problematic idea of truth to the self."

As a form of ""situational metafiction,"" Coetzee's writing reconstructs and critiques some of the key discourses in the history of colonialism and apartheid from the eighteenth century to the present. While self-conscious about fiction-making, it takes seriously the condition of the society in which it is produced.<br />Attwell begins by describing the intellectual and political contexts surrounding Coetzee's fiction and then provides a developmental analysis of his six novels, drawing on Coetzee's other writings in stylistics, literary criticism, translation, political journalism and popular culture. Elegantly written, Attwell's analysis deals with both Coetzee's subversion of the dominant culture around him and his ability to see the complexities of giving voice to the anguish of South Africa."

An Imaginary Life,,David Malouf,eng,1442072,,Vintage,156,,,,"In the first century AD, Publius Ovidius Naso, the most urbane and irreverent poet of imperial Rome, was banished to a remote village on the edge of the Black Sea. From these sparse facts, one of our most distinguished novelists has fashioned an audacious and supremely moving work of fiction.<br /><br />Marooned on the edge of the known world, exiled from his native tongue, Ovid depends on the kindness of barbarians who impale their dead and converse with the spirit world. But then he becomes the guardian of a still more savage creature, a feral child who has grown up among deer. What ensues is a luminous encounter between civilization and nature, as enacted by a poet who once catalogued the treacheries of love and a boy who slowly learns how to give it."

The Great World,,David Malouf,eng,1003182,,Vintage,336,,,,"Every city, town and village has its memorial to war. Nowhere are these more eloquent than in Australia, generations of whose young men have enlisted to fight other people's battles - from Gallipoli and the Somme to Malaya and Vietnam. In THE GREAT WORLD, his finest novel yet, David Malouf gives a voice to that experience. But THE GREAT WORLD is more than a novel of war. Ranging over seventy years of Australian life, from Sydney's teeming King's Cross to the tranquil backwaters of the Hawkesbury River, it is a remarkable novel of self-knowledge and lost innocence, of survival and witness."
Remembering Babylon,,David Malouf,,995164,,Random House Value Publishing,,,,,"In this rich and compelling novel, written in language of astonishing poise and resonance, one of Australia's greatest living writers gives and immensely powerful vision of human differences and eternal divisions. In the mid-1840s a thirteen-year-old British cabin boy, Gemmy Fairley, is cast ashore in the far north of Australia and taken in by aborigines. Sixteen years later he moves back into the world of Europeans, among hopeful yet terrified settlers who are staking out their small patch of home in an alien place. To them, Gemmy stands as a different kind of challenge: he is a force that at once fascinates and repels. His own identity in this new world is as unsettling to him as the knowledge he brings to others of the savage, the aboriginal."
The Complete Stories,,David Malouf,,9557,,Pantheon,528,,,,"From the internationally acclaimed Australian writer: a single volume gathering a brilliant new collection of his short fiction, <i>Every Move You Make,</i> and all of his previously published stories.<br /><br />In the heretofore unpublished <i>Every Move You Make</i>: bookish boys and taciturn men, strong women and wayward sons, fathers and daughters, lovers and husbands, a composer and his muse, a builder-architect and his legacy--here are their stories, whole lives brought dramatically into focus and powerfully rooted in the vividly rendered landscape of the vast Australian continent, from the mysterious, glittering Valley of Lagoons in Far North Queensland to bohemian Sydney to Ayres Rock in the Great Victoria Desert. These tender, subtle, and intimate stories give us men and women looking for something they seem to have missed, or missed out on, puzzling over not only their own lives but also the place they have come to occupy in the lives of others.<br /><br />Heartbreakingly beautiful, richly satisfying, <i>The Complete Stories</i> also includes David Malouf’s short fiction from <i>Dream Stuff, Antipodes,</i> and <i>Child’s Play</i>. It is a major literary event."

In a parting moment, a young woman hired to ""marry"" vacationing soldiers, grasps the weight of the word ""woe."" When a failing farmer senselessly murders a wandering aborigine, he imperils his son but discovers in the spring of sympathy that follows the power to influence others. Wise and moving, startling and lyrical, <i> </i><b>Dream Stuff</b> reverberates with the unpredictability of human experience, revealing people who are shaped by the mysterious rhythms of nature as well as the ghosts of their own pasts."
